# Notebooks 
The following directory has the notebooks containing the experiments performed over the fallacy classifiers. The following order of descriptions might help in provinding an insight into where to start looking from. And the names of the directories are self-explanatory for the topics the experiments that have been carried out in the notebooks pertain to. 

## Experiments with GPT-J 
* Setting up GPT-J and using it along with the prompt-structure to extract prompts for various arguments. 

## Experiments with RoBERTa 
* Contains notebooks for training and testing RoBERTa over the fine-grained binary classification of fallacies. 

## Coarse Grained Classifiers 
* Contains the notebook for training and testing RoBERTa over the coarse-grained multi-class classification of fallacies. 
* Also has a notebook that consists of experimental results that were obtained by running the classifiers over the IBM 30K ranking dataset. 

## Experiments with DeBERTa 
* Contains the notebooks for training and testing DeBERTa over the fine-grained binary classification of fallacies. 

## Data Transformations 
The following experiments are contained within this: 
1. Evaluation of different keyword generators for testing their efficiency for extracting keywords from arguments. 
2. Transforming data for mapping the broad-coarse grained classes to fine-grained classes. 
3. Transforming data for creating a premise-hypothesis binary classification task for the T5 classifier. 

## CSKG 
The following experiments are contained within this: 
1. Evaluation of 1-hop and 2-hop relations using CSKG with the keywords extracted from sentences. 
2. Experimentation with AMR Parsers and generating visualization graphs of the parse trees.
