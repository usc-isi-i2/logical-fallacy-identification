"In an example used by Sigmund Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams, a man accused by his neighbor of having returned a kettle in a damaged condition offered three arguments:
That he had returned the kettle undamaged;
That it was already damaged when he borrowed it;
That he had never borrowed it in the first place.
",fallacy of logic,"In an example used by Sigmund Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams, a man accused by his neighbor of having returned a kettle in a damaged condition offered three arguments: That he had returned the kettle undamaged; That it was already damaged when he borrowed it; That he had never borrowed it in the first place. The man's third reason is a reductio ad absurdum: one cannot borrow a kettle if they did not have it, which in turn means that the second reason is false, because the kettle must already have been borrowed. This suggests that Freud was using a reductio argument, and that in this case the third reason is the right one, despite there being three reasons to pick from. For the example to be valid a fourth ""unfalsifiable"" reason must be given. It might be argued by a critic that reason 3 could be falsified if the neighbor admitted to borrowning the kettle and returning it in a damaged condition, thereby admitting to a contradiction. However, one could argue that the neighbor believes that the kettle was returned in a damaged condition, and therefore they are not actually contradictory. I was wondering about the plausibility of this reductio argument since I have never seen it presented in a formal setting. Is it valid; and therefore a plausible argument, or should it be rejected as absurd; and therefore not presented as valid by the formalist? A: The argument you are proposing, of course, is a fallacy. The whole point of argumentation is to try to refute an argument. The argument must be wrong in order for a refutation to be plausible.

Teen suicide, among non-aborted and thus presumably ""wanted"" children, has doubled. Violent crime has more than doubled."" Claim: advocated legalized abortion Distortion: destroy one fourth of a generation A: I think the distortion in sentence #4 is that the students think she looks horrible, not that she's ugly. The actual distorted meaning is that the students think they found her ugly. Sentence #6 is incorrect: Students want cell phones because they can text their friends about school. They do not text their friends for fun. Sentence #8 contains several distortions of the same topic, namely the student’s actions, beliefs and opinions. Sentence #9 could be read to mean that someone else has convinced the student that a tax incentive is a good idea, though it seems to me more likely that the student would say that he’s skeptical that such a tax credit would be worthwhile, rather than believing the claim that someone else wants him to believe the same thing. Sentence #10 seems odd to me, because the sentence seems to be contrasting the way that the senator views the world with the senator's belief about how the world might actually be. The first clause (""quite the contrary"") could introduce the sentence, or it could be used in the way that ""the other day"" is often used in spoken English; i.e. to compare the state of mind that the senator is in now with one that he was in previously. Sentence #13 sounds to me somewhat like something an actor might say in a dramatic performance that he was unable to give. This effect, plus the fact that the entire utterance appears to be an expression of anger, would tend to suggest that the speaker is a very angry person about something. Sentence #16 reads a bit weird to me. The speaker seems to me to be saying that the reasons people give for not wanting abortions are not persuasive, though I wonder whether they all actually disagree or simply have other disagreements that they're not going to share with the listener. You're asking for many different questions and I'm giving many different answers. It sounds like you might benefit from someone providing you with a more objective reading of the text. <|endoftext|"," Claim: advocated legalized abortion Distortion: destroy one fourth of a generation A: I think the distortion in sentence #4 is that the students think she looks horrible, not that she's ugly. The actual distorted meaning is that the students think they found her ugly. Sentence #6 is incorrect: Students want cell phones because they can text their friends about school. They do not text their friends for fun. Sentence #8 contains several distortions of the same topic, namely the student’s actions, beliefs and opinions. Sentence #9 could be read to mean that someone else has convinced the student that a tax incentive is a good idea, though it seems to me more likely that the student would say that he’s skeptical that such a tax credit would be worthwhile, rather than believing the claim that someone else wants him to believe the same thing.

Ted: I never said that any random crap was a fact to me at all, so you're wrong. But, thanks for playing. I suppose we could both be wrong, because we can't really be sure of that. So, to recap: 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, and 16 represent correct versions of sentences 11, 8, 15, and 16 respectively. For sentence 11, the answer is actually 1 and not 2. The only sentence in the set where the answer is actually 2 is sentence 15, which is correct. The other 8 sentences are all wrong. 2. These are the correct versions of sentences 10, 1, 7, 11, and 12, respectively: 2-1: either you decide 2-2: either you decide 2-12: you text 2-15: you go to bed. 3. For sentence 12, the answer is actually 2. For sentence 9, the answer is actually 1, and not 2. A: Let's consider the problem statement first. The answer for what is missing are: 1, 2, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16; 1 and 7 are correct; 2, 8 and 13 are wrong. Now, for the solution: We do not know what a parenthesis is, so we may miss a parenthesis that was never there. I will assume that parenthesis in these answers is a space: 1. You can either eat the candy or not. 2. You can either submit your requirements now or suffer slow annihilation at the hands of your competitors. 3. We're either willing to open the economy completely or we'll suffer slow annihilation at the hands of our competitors. 4. If we are too scared to open the economy completely, then we'll have to keep it closed forever. 5. We should ban all hairspray or the world will end! 6.

On a personal note, I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian and religious/political/ethical beliefs aside, I give him credit for having the cojones to make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs.Example #2: A: You can’t prove something exists from mere existence, therefore it doesn’t exist B: Your conclusion is a false one because something just exists and nothing else. This is a common tactic of atheists and skeptics, and the two terms are often interchanged. I will explain what I mean by the term “false one” in the first paragraph, and will then explain how it differs from the atheist/skeptical term in the second. If you are a person who believes in God there are many things in our lives that exist but can’t be proved from mere existence/existence and also things that can’t be proved from our existence/existence/being. An example is the Big Bang, something can be said to have existed from its existence/existence, but can’t be proven from its existence because the things that were at the beginning will remain after the Big Bang and those things may have been unable to be seen, heard or measured. In the example of the Christian broadcaster Camping, I would disagree that he is a Christian and that he is/was a “false Christian” because he makes a falsifiable claim about his (his personal) beliefs(i.e. his religion/what he believes) and that claim is that he would use mathematical calculations and historical facts in an attempt to predict where in time, i.e. years, the world will end. On the surface, this means he doesn’t believe that the world will end and he is therefore not a ""false Christian"" because he is saying something about God’s existence. This is actually not very far off from what many Christians believe (see for example the above example #2 and below). The difference between the “false Christian” and atheists/skeptics lies in the following three points: The Christians and “false Christians” make the claim that things exist independently of their being. This means that they do not believe in God and that if God exists everything that exists is dependent upon God Atheists are just saying that the claim is wrong due to logical fallacy and historical/evolutionary/mathematical facts. There are other arguments as to why the people from the example #1 of the Christian broadcaster are not “false Christians”, and I will not deal with them here. Example #1 is interesting because it’s quite common to have the situation when two or more people say something independently of each other and then one person denies that their claim is true, and the other person says “ok, that’s why you’re wrong” and moves onto another topic with “yeah, well we’re both wrong,”.

Therefore, Person 1 wins this argument. Person 1 - more true than 2 1) Cyclists do not run red lights and do not endanger pedestrians.

In her address to the board of trustees, she says, ""We must raise tuition to cover the cost of new books. Otherwise the library will be forced to close."" Of what fallacy is this an example?

However, we're not talking about ""favouring"" music by either band or team. It sounds like the speaker is trying to make a distinction between the two sentences. The first sentence states that if the university shuts down the library then the author will be in trouble. The second sentence basically says that if the university doesn't raise the tuition, then the library will suffer. However, this kind of distinction makes no sense, so we don't get the difference we want... So really, this question is asking about whether it is a fallacy that the speaker is being deceptive, so that they can be said to have committed a form of word salad - confusingly using word meanings that don't quite fit together. In fact, the distinction between these examples is not as stark as many people claim, because neither the speaker in sentence 6, nor the speaker in sentence 10, is being deceptive in any way.
