The table shows the result (Argument 1, for sentence $i$, vs Argument 2), the number of examples for each argument and the percentage. These percentage values reveal a big difference in how the system and human annotators evaluate the argumentation structure. Human annotators assign a high weight on the relation among the arguments, in fact all the arguments have the same weight, the number of occurrences of a sentence in the corpus does not play any role for them. Moreover, the score of a sentence may depend on how it is related to other sentences. However in case of a task as this one, where the aim is not to perform human annotations but only to evaluate the classification output of a model, the percentage of examples is a key factor. As already mentioned, the task is to evaluate the accuracy of a model in evaluating argumentation structures. In practice, when a task like this will be given to a model, this is achieved by performing the annotation with the support of the model. In other words, the task is to evaluate how the model understands the argumentative structure of a sentence, not to evaluate how correct is a sentence when taken alone. To assess the performance of the proposed task, it is necessary to compare the manual annotation results with those provided by the machine, since we are interested in evaluating the capability of the systems of automatically identifying argumentative structures.
