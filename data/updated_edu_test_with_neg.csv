10," Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

36," Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

It's a bit of pain to see some sentences duplicated twice or thrice in a row, but this is no problem at all. To solve this problem, we simply need some rules:

* If we have two answers both in the same row, we can mark the second one as right. This is a pretty general answer of this problem.

* If we find same sentence in different rows, we can always mark the last one as right.

* If we have four answers in a row, the last answer can be marked as right.

** Solution

We have the following rules to make the above problem:

<br>
Let s be an indexed sentence which ranges from 1 to n inclusive. If s = n, it has to be marked as right.

*  If there are two answers both in the same row, and the last answer has a greater index, then the second answer can be marked as right as well.

*  Let $be a positive integer. We also use $n$ to stand for the greatest indexed sentence in this paragraph. $n-1$ stands for the second-to-the-rightest indexed sentence. $n$ holds the last sentence that can be right.

*  The index of each sentence represents the order it was written.

** Example

| index | sentence |
| --- | ---- |

<h3>Generate from a given corpus of text.</h3>

[https://github.com/rjurney/nlp-corpus-
generator](https://github.com/rjurney/nlp-corpus-generator)

---
## Step #3: Parse the words into tokens and extract the semantic content

---

After you get your training corpus out of step #2, you need to ""teach"" OpenVINO
how to parse that text properly.

OpenVINO's training will need to do:

* Convert all of your text into plain numbers, e.g., convert all words (including 
  capitalization, numbers, punctuation, etc.) into individual numbers. (You can also 
  use a text file instead of stdin).

* Extract words and POS tags from the text.

* Parse all words into a list of individual words, while allowing for words that
  might exist in plural forms. (I.e., both ""men"" and ""people"" should be converted to 
  exactly the same list of words, with the same corresponding tag. lbl02l

### OpenVINO Text Processing: A high level overview

OpenVINO already has everything you need for this task, you just need to tell it 
how to use those capabilities.
