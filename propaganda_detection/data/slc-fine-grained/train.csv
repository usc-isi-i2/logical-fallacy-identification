"BUILD THE WALL!""",Slogans
Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing,O
"Garcia Zarate, a 45-year-old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle, was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges.",O
"The jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison.",O
"Steinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015.",O
The bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier.,O
Garcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident — they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.,O
"Gonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver.",O
"Prosecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger.",O
They said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene.,O
"Beyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle.",O
"At the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s.",O
"He faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge.",O
"San Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015.",O
"As a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies.",O
The DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody.,O
"San Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies.",O
But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody.,O
The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.,O
"Though the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding.",O
"San Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights.",O
"President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of ""Illegal Immigration.""",O
"Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against ""sanctuary cities.""",O
"Early on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration.",O
Trump tweeted.,O
"In fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting — his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry.",O
"Lax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration.",O
"In contrast, Steinle's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and ""sanctuary"" policies.",O
"They have both condemned Trump for ""sensationalizing"" Steinle's death to advance anti-immigration policies, and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials, who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",O
Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face,Loaded_Language

It’s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration. ,Doubt
His decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality-TV star’s weakness as a presidential candidate.,"Name_Calling,Labeling"
"We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him, and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump’s biases: The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump’s cut-of-his-jib test by looking the part.",Loaded_Language
"It’s still not clear that Kavanaugh’s nomination is doomed, but it’s certainly in severe trouble.",Loaded_Language
And Trump hasn’t learned it yet.,Doubt
"For one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.","Exaggeration,Minimisation"
"It’s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh.",Doubt
"First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward.",Loaded_Language
"The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can’t shoot straight and that he’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.","Name_Calling,Labeling"
"As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.",Appeal_to_Authority
"And yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately.",Loaded_Language

"But it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular -- most people, and the entire press corps, love transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadn't been initially disclosed.",Loaded_Language
"There are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges, and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers.","Name_Calling,Labeling"
The president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate.,O
"To begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.",O
That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo.,O
That wasn’t entirely a Trump mistake.,O
"The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal.",O
"In some ways, that’s successful coalition-building, and what he’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges.",O
"Still, it’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it’s another to turn the whole process over to them.",O
We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.,O
1,O
"Either way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting.",O
The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start.,O
"After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay.",O
"Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations.",O
"Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble.",O
"It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh’s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more.",O
"Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn’t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.",O
2,O
Sometimes it’s worth taking risks.,O
Presidents who shy away from anything that’s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.,O
"It’s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option.",O
3,O
"When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate.",O
"Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.",O
But there’s an art to minimizing damage.,O
"Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing. ",O
"If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn’t Trump’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.",O
"Meanwhile, Trump’s behavior has been as erratic as ever.",O
"He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview.",O
"The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.",O
"A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative.",O
"And, for that matter, they’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal.",O
"Trump’s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts.",O
"Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.",O
"I've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind.",O
I still think that's true.,O
"In the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.",O
Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.,O
Perhaps.,O
"And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway.",O
"So, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.",O

But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program’s popularity shouldn’t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.,O
The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.,O
"The suit quotes from one lesson: “If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.” Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.",O
It says: “So picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur!,O

Wouldn’t that be so wild!”,O
The district declined a request to observe one of the classes.,O
"Elizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case.",O
"Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class.",O
"Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren’t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out.",O
Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book.,O
Eventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class.,O

Ray Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades.,O
"The church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does.",O
"For Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge.",O
"“There is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I’ve read almost every piece of history that’s in the Bible has eventually been proven,” he said.",O
“We see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.”,O
"Hurt, whose son, the Rev.",O
"J.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class.",O
But he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.,O
"“If you read the Bible, you’re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,” he said.",O
“You don’t have to push religion with it.,O
It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.”,O
"The idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn’t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools.",O
"“As a person of faith myself, I don’t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,” White said.",O
White holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.,O
"She argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn’t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn’t mean they should be taught during the instructional day.",O
She also said it was untrue that children who didn’t take the class weren’t made to “feel different or ostracized.”,O

"The program “is unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,” said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",O
“There is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.”,O
"The amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from “organizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools’ students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.”",O
"Charles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn’t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form.",O
"“This is a loser for the school district,” Haynes said.",O
“It’s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.,O
Students at that age really aren’t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.”,O
Haynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity.,O

Lawyers for Assange and Manafort denounced the report as false.,O

"The campaign seized on the emails to undermine Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton.",O

Wait!,O
It’s all a MISTRANSLATION!,O
Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.,O
"It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.",O
"In other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.",O
"But it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.",O
"Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.",O
Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.,O
Dawn Goldstein,O
Here we go again.,O
So what does the Latin say?,O
Here is the paragraph in the official Latin:,O
"Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.",O
"Yes, and so what?",O
"Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.",O
"So, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God.",O
Big difference.,O
But just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?,O
It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.,O
Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.,O
"What about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?",O
"Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.",O
Give.,O
Me.,O
A.,O
Break.,O
"A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.",O
"Likewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”",O
Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.,O
For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.,O
"Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”",O
"According to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.",O
It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.,O
"Indeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?",O
Are you perfect?,O
"Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.",O
"And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.",O
No problem here!,O
has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.,O
"But the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”",O
"Moreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:",O
"If, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).",O
"This Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.",O
See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.,O
Shaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.,O
But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.,O
"Moreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.",O
"But Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.",O
As Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”,O
"But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.",O
"In so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).",O
"Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.",O
And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.,O
"A similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.",O
"Meanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.",O
"In a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura—the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.",O
"And this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.",O
"Will this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction?",O
We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.,O

Receipt Shows Paddock Had Another Guest in His Room Before Shooting,O

An image posted on Facebook by a man who claims he served Stephen Paddock room service shows that the gunman was with a guest during his time at the Mandalay Bay hotel four days before the massacre took place.,O
"The receipt shows an employee named Antonio served two guests an “IRA_MB,” which means “In Room Dining, Mandalay Bay.”",O
The table number is “32135” – which equates to Paddock’s room number (135) on the 32nd floor.,O
"Paddock ordered a burger, a bagel with cream cheese, a potato soup, one bottle of water and two Pepsis, suggesting that there was another person eating with him in the room.",O
The receipt shows the number “2” next to the word “Guests”.,O

Paddock’s guest could not have been his girlfriend Marilou Danley because she was in the Philippines at the time.,O

The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event,O
"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.",O
The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.,O
The fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel.,O
Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”,O
"The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel.",O
"He has claimed that the ""Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society"" especially in ""crucial sectors like banking, finance, media” where ""their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers"" and that their power strengthens “conspiracy theories about ‘Jewish control’ that are reminiscent of the infamous “’Protocols of the Elders of Zion.’”",O
Robert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one-state plan for eliminating Israel.,O
"The American Jewish Historical Society is co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas.",O
"An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel.",O
"The “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country.",O
That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.,O
The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.,O
But it’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History’s headquarters.,O
AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.,O
"And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.",O
"During the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.",O
The Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.,O
"In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.",O
Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.,O
His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.,O
AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.,O
The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.,O
Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.,O
Leo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.,O
What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?,O
AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.,O
"But when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.",O
“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.,O
"The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.",O
But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.,O
The exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.,O
And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.,O
JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.,O
The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.,O
It’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.,O
Instead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.,O
And it’s no mystery why.,O
The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.,O
"Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.",O
"Open Hillel seeks to ""open"" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.",O
"Berman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.",O
She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.,O
"Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.",O
"When we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.",O
Myers is a symptom of the problem.,O
As is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.,O
A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.,O
"Unlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.",O
And yet it’s inescapable.,O
The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.,O
Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.,O
And it will not be satisfied with anything less.,O
"During the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship.",O
The anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.,O
And support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.,O
Not when JVP is at AJHS.,O
Sometimes the choices are murky.,O
Other times they are simple and easy.,O
"When the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy.",O
"As the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple.",O
But they will not be any less difficult.,O
Opposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.,O
"The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.",O
Speaking out against hate is easiest when it’s weakest.,O
It’s hardest when it’s strongest.,O
"When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out.",O
We don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.,O

It also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.,O

There are lessons here for all of us.,O

"Nor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called “transignification” and “transfiguration,” or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Our Lord is no longer present.",Black-and-White_Fallacy

Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist,O
"Pope Paul VI’s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, “Mysterium Fidei,” was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species.",O
"Having been raised in Remi de Roo’s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist.",O
The understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock.,O
(Read the full document here. ),O
"Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times.",O
"Therefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace.",O
"But in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that.",O
"The encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point.",O
It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and – most importantly – unapologetically stated.,O
"It came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities.",O
Like C.S.,O
"Lewis’s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth.",O
"Something that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope’s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:",O
"“At the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.”",O
"In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality.",O
I remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement… “By doing what?,O
!”,O
What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren’t true?,O
"By the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school.",O
What led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point.,O
"It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings.",O
"While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: “I could be wrong.” At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked.",O
"But stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short.",O
It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses.,O
"In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn’t come from her enemies.",O
"The same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, “Do you have any books about Catholicism?",O
"Something official?” The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories.",O
Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.,O
"Having no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random.",O
"The description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading.",O
"But even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I’d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world.",O
"Reading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues.",O
"Given what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:",O
"When dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment.",O
"Who, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:",O
"[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith.",O
"It is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved.",O
"Keeping Cardinal Ottaviani’s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread…",O
[…],O
"And therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject.",O
[1],O
Those of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn’t about marriage.,O
It’s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood.,O
We know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second.,O
They are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.,O
This knowledge – that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ – can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd.,O
The places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives.,O
"The bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses.",O
"A case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England.",O
"In March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the “reality of the Eucharist” could new vocations to the priesthood be found.",O
“In treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist.,O
It’s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.,O
It’s a “stitch-up” as the English call it; a fix.,O
"You make it a matter of “mercy” (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church.",O
"You have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity.",O
"And of course, we are seeing it starting already.",O
"It’s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever.",O
As if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II/Benedict XVI period out of history.,O
"It will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of “conservative” seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung.",O
It is easy to see what is coming next.,O
"Once certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule.",O
"Not being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual “time bombs,” ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors.",O
I haven’t looked it up.,O
I’m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it’s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption.,O
"And I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of “official” things.",O
"From saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited.",O
"O God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty.",O
"In this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time.",O
For me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.,O

In the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.,O
"Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.",O
"As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.",O
"The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.",O
"Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.",O
"Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.",O
Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.,O
"And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.",O
"What’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.",O
The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre,O
"As of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:",O

Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?,O
"Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.",O
Police didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.,O
"Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?",O

Robert Fastiggi • 13 hours ago,O
"In the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the “official” Latin text rather than the “original” Latin text.",O
"This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS.",O
The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.,O
"I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:",O
Posted on LifeSiteNews:,O
"Prof. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases.",O
"In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”",O
Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.,O
The “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.,O
What might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.,O
"Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.",O
"In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.",O
We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.,O
Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.,O
It’s really just the opposite.,O
AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.,O
"In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.",O
He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.,O
The father is happy.,O
Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick?,O
"No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”",O
This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.,O
God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.,O
"God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.",O
This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.,O
It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.,O
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago,O
I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.,O
I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.,O
"Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.",O
What constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?,O
No example is provided in AL because none can be.,O
The notion is nonsensical.,O
Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.,O
But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.,O
"Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.",O
"At any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.",O
"As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.",O
"Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”",O
"No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place.",O
It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.,O

Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “More Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.”,O
Robert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago,O
I would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.,O
I give him credit for his colorful style.,O
"Unfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.”",O
In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.,O
The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.,O
Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.,O
"Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession.",O
"With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis.",O
"Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks.",O
This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.,O
"As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence.",O
"As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.",O
"Beyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church.",O
"This, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751.",O
I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “Leviathan Church” under Pope Francis.,O
A more simple question to him would be this: “Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?”,O
I apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.,O
"I believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “Leviathan Church” distinct from “the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.”",O
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago,O
"If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina—then I cannot help him.",O
"To make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes’s Leviathan.",O
"I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists.",O
That it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.,O
"Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,” who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to “submit” to anything via AL.",O

Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative,O
"The infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such.",O
"Jesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery.",O
So who is Jesus Campos?,O
"That burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there’s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we’ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room.",O
"The ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard.",O
"At first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock’s room on the 32nd floor.",O
Police said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock’s assault on concertgoers—potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.,O
"But now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught.",O
"Police have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response.",O
But the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started.,O
Did Campos call 911?,O
What happened during those six minutes?,O
Much of Campos’s story and background remains a mystery.,O

“This is a young man that I work with day in and day out.,O
Any financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.”,O
"Strangely, a picture of Campos wasn’t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that “due to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.”",O
Their own narrative is quickly shattering.,O
"Las Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos’s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers.",O
"McMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm.",O
"While on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance.",O
Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.,O
A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.,O
"As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.",O
"And still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically.",O

What is going on here?,O
Negotiations.,O
The art of the deal.,O
The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.,O
It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.,O
"Under long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return.",O
That’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.,O
Trump wants something in return.,O
We don’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.,O

It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.,O
"All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.",O

The CIA’s ground?,O
National security?,O
Really?,O
The CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret “methods” of intelligence gathering.,O
That should be big news.,O
"You see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination.",O
"Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.",O
"Let’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.",O
"Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said.",O
He said he was being framed.,O
"Now, let’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed.",O
"In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.",O
"It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.",O
"The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.",O
"What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.",O
"It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.",O
But there was another big operation to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides before the assassination.,O
"It had to do with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.",O
"Today, Oswald’s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.",O
The CIA’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.,O
"As I wrote in my October 11 article, “Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place.",O
Do the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?,O
Of course not.,O
And they don’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.,O
The CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.,O
But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.,O
"In 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.",O
Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.,O

SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue,O
The Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB’s decision to sack Fr.,O
"Thomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office.",O
Or at least to stop attacking them.,O
"In a letter made public November 1st, Fr.",O
"Weinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican’s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused “chronic confusion” among the faithful and bishops.",O
"In an interview yesterday with John Allen’s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, “I don’t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops.",O
"Neither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.”",O
"And sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr.",O
"Of course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.",O
Political consultants often ask: how does it look?,O
"As though the fog of irony weren’t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis’ cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account.",O
"Which, it must be said, only proves Fr.",O
Weinandy’s point once again.,O
Some of the criticism has been unusually sharp.,O
Fr.,O
"Just as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.”",O
"In his letter, Fr.",O
Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis’ agenda.,O
"In fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,",O
“I see that Fr.,O
Thomas Weinandy has been squashed.,O
"He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet.",O
"To me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.",O
"He is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching.",O
I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience.,O
I imagine that it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.”,O
"When I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK’s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, “This is absolutely right.",O
Not a man to seek out confrontation.”,O
The Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.,O
Weinandy’s concerns.,O
He said the pope is…,O
Fostering “chronic confusion.”,O
“Demeaning” the importance of doctrine.,O
Our friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.,O
Fr.,O
"Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.",O
"Like the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.",O
"Notable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people.",O
"The pope, he said, seems “to censor and even mock” critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a “kind of calumny…alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.”",O
"In an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but “more concerned about the good that my letter might do.” The letter “expresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who’ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions.",O
I wanted them to know that I listened.”,O
"In fact, Fr.",O
"Which inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.",O
"When Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a “good” prelate being got rid of.",O
But his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.,O
Ed Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he’s on.,O
"Most recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, “Cardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of ‘Amoris Laetitia’” in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.",O
"Or sacrilege either, I guess.",O
Or something.,O
"Somehow the “new evangelization” is involved in this, though it’s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it’s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can’t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.",O
"Anyway, the result of this is a “marriage-like relationship” about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things.",O
Or be too “extreme”.,O
Because that could be too polarizing.,O
And mean.,O
"And anyway, sins of the flesh aren’t the worst things ever.",O
"There are, like, “different levels” of gravity, you know?",O
"And, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?",O
"“Spirit’s sins” like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than “sins of the flesh,” you know?",O
"Which are, like, only a result of “human weakness,” right?",O
"Apparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the “polarization” it has caused has been “regrettable”.",O
"Muller, with little backing from Pope Benedict – who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences – and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line.",O
The fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.,O
And it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.,O
"But since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides.",O
With this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.,O
Perhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.,O
Weinandy’s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.,O
"As my friend said, maybe “it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,” assuming there are any left.",O

"As part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated.",O
"While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.",O
There is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.,O
"So, why were they targeted for assassination?",O
"Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later.",O
That’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.,O
The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.,O
"Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal.",O

"This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.",O
"Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.",O
But he also went a step further.,O
He said that he was being framed for the crime.,O
The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?,O
"Wouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?",O
"If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.",O
Who would those confederates be?,O

An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.,O

"The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.",O

"﻿Communion to Adulterers Promulgated as ""Authentic Magisterium""",O
"Last week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)—the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See—published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin.",O
"If papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large.",O
"Concerning these guidelines that allow ""the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist"" in ""complex circumstances"" where ""limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt"" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:",O
"Until now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an ""Apostolic Letter,"" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State.",O
"The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents—the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines—to bear the character of his ""authentic Magisterium,"" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.",O
"Hence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when ""concrete circumstances"" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared ""magisterial"" by the Holy See.",O
"The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration.",O
"St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: ""If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.""",O
"The fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it.",O
Cardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:,O
"Rescript ""from an Audience with His Holiness""",O
"The Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.",O

"The Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: ""Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals.",O
"Some rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g.",O
"the interpretation of a law.""",O
It appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.,O
"Pope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?",O
"We shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare ""ex-cathedra"" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as ""extraordinary magisterium.""",O
"In an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to ""formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.""",O

That explains the effort of “The Great Left Hope” to have his client’s felony gun possession conviction tossed.,Causal_Oversimplification
San Francisco Show Trial Sequel,O
"Last week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.",O
The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.,O
"Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.",O
San Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.,O
Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.,O
"“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters.",O
"Gonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.",O
"As he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.",O
"The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists.",O
"In 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.",O
You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”,O
In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.,O
In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.,O
"On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.",O
"In jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals.",O
"True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.",O
So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.,O
"As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.",O
"In a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.",O
"In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.",O
"This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.",O
Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.,O
"After firing, he tossed the gun in the water.",O
"He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.",O
"Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.",O
Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.,O
Denunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.,O
"As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.",O
"On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.",O
"In this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.",O
"Out for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.",O
"As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”",O
"Since Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.",O
Any observer of the case could believe it probably will be.,O

"Of that book, no less than Robert Royal—signaling growing alarm over the Bergoglian Debacle in the Catholic mainstream— has written : “About 90 percent of it is simply incontrovertible, and cannot help but clarify who Francis is and what he’s about.” And the picture that emerges in stark relief in The Dictator Pope, as Life Site News reports , is that of “a power-hungry, manipulative dictator, [who] celebrated the abdication of Benedict XVI” because he knew what it meant: that the plan to give him the Keys of Peter in 2005 would finally come to fruition in 2013.","Name_Calling,Labeling"
"“We elected you to make reforms, not to smash everything!” Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri, a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013, reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican.",Loaded_Language
"Sandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing “buyer’s remorse,” as documented most recently in the explosive best-seller The Dictator Pope .",Loaded_Language
"The Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord’s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God’s words: “And lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],” which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a “not a good translation.” Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered mélange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.",Loaded_Language

"But the consequences of this Pope’s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half-baked theological notions, such as “discernment” (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.",Loaded_Language

"At this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian “clarification” can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.",Loaded_Language
"Continued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge.",Appeal_to_fear-prejudice

New Footage From Las Vegas Massacre Reveals Possible Muzzle Flashes From Helicopters That May Have Conducted “Air Assault”,O
What appears to be muzzle flashes emitting from multiple aircraft can be seen on numerous videos captured on the night of the massacre.,O
LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — Newly released footage of the October 1 massacre posted on YouTube by the NICK VEGAS channel appears to confirm what Intellihub’s founder and editor-in-chief Shepard Ambellas pointed out in late October when he presented evidence of the strategic air assault on The Alex Jones Show in great detail.,O
"The video shows what appears to be muzzle flashes emanating from the airspace between the Delano Hotel and Mandalay Bay, an airspace that should be free of obstruction altogether.",O
A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas in mid-November which revealed that no aircraft should be occupying that airspace between the hours of 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on the night of the shooting (i.e.,O
no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time.),O
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are not allowed to hover in the City of Las Vegas without a permit nor are they allowed to lurk behind buildings lower than their roof lines.,O
"The first of a series of muzzles flashes can be seen coming from several different elevations, possibly from as many as 3 aircraft (helicopters).",O
The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video.,O
Note: To see the flashes you must view the video on ‘1080p’ and set it to ‘full screen’ and look between the two hotels (adjust the video speed to 25%.),O
"The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios “First Shots” video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2, just one day after the shooting.",O

PROOF: The LVMPD And FBI Failed To Catalog At Least One Deceased Las Vegas Massacre Victim As Death Toll Rises,O
LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have failed to catalogue at least one deceased victim of the 1 October massacre which reportedly only left 58 people dead.,O
The woman’s lifeless body can be seen being drug across the parking lot by several men who placed the body behind a pick-up truck while the gunfire continued.,O
"The event was reported by Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas on Nov. 11, 2017, in the article titled Private surveillance footage reveals “helicopter hovering overhead” at time of Las Vegas Massacre, FBI never asked for tape, after an excerpt of the footage aired on Tucker Carlson Tonight.",O
"At 10:16 p.m., two men drag a “fallen victim” across the parking lot.",O
"The men position the victim behind a Ford pickup truck, presumably to shield themselves and the victim from taking any further incoming rounds as they attempted to give the victim medical assistance.",O
"“Later at ten-twenty-four p.m., one of the men places his shirt across the victim’s face and then at ten-thirty-two a man places what appears to be a blanket or towel over the body after they had given up hope,” Tucker Carlson said.",O
“Police only arrive in this area for the first time around ten-forty-five p.m. when the body is still there.” The victim’s body was eventually was loaded into the back of a Ford Raptor pickup truck at 11:50 p.m. and taken away.,O
"Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 p.m. and 10:16 p.m. a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera which Carlson claims is from a “helicopter hovering overhead.” A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.",O
"However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer.",O
"In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.",O
"However, the official report failed to catalogue the dead woman who was shot in the parking lot of a Haven Street business.",O
The following image is taken from page 34 of the LVMPD preliminary report which shows the seven victims and their locations of death numbered in yellow.,O
The next photo shows where the unnamed victim was located.,O
The victim can be seen being dragged in the following video.,O
"The following day, several men, one of which presumably was Fox News anchor Sean Hannity (who was heavily guarded by a five-man security team), received mobile haircuts in the very same parking lot, in nearly the same spot the victim’s body was dragged to.",O

SPECIAL REPORT: Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases,O
There is not a single piece of evidence against him.,O
It is all calumny.,O
Is that clear?”,O
"Writing for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, “Let the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018… he has revealed himself like no one else could.”",O
But it gets worse than this.,O
"Though he’s “sticking with Francis” for now, Winters wrote, “I wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church.",O
"On January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, “Within the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.”",O
“These remarks are at the least shameful.,O
"At the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up.",O
"The script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors’ testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else.",O
Three separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him.,O
The second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman.,O
She asked: ‘Why are not the victims’ testimonies proof for you?,O
"Why do you not believe them?’ The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of ‘no evidence’ against the bishop.”",O
"Indeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis’ trip to Latin America – dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope’s appearances and in the press – was in part intended as “an apology tour” to abuse survivors.",O
Which is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio’s ability to turn on a dime.,O
All was going as planned.,O
"On Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests.",O
"He made all the right noises, talking about his “pain and shame,” and reportedly even crying, at what happened.",O
24 hours later he was calling them liars.,O
"James Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers.",O
"He told the BBC at a press conference, “What the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.” The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis’s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, “Does he need a photo, a selfie, as proof?",O
"Sorry Austen, we didn’t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.”",O
"Although the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015.",O
Barros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima’s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010.,O
This is refuted by Karadima’s victims – deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal – who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.,O
"Last Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults.",O
"In 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter’s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the “suffering” of the Church in Chile over the issue.",O
The insults were not forgotten.,O
"The jab certainly wasn’t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport.",O
"One of the protesters told the BBC, “He doesn’t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things?",O
He thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.”,O
"This also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O’Malley – a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope’s sex abuse commission – who said, “It is understandable that Pope Francis’ statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.”",O
"Of course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was.",O
"“I have to ask forgiveness because the word ‘proof’ wounded,” he said.",O
"“It wounded many people who were abused…I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound.",O
"“And I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face ‘bring me a letter, a proof.’ It’s a slap.",O
"And I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn’t think.”",O
"He doubled down, saying, “I have not heard any victim of Barros.",O
"They did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court.",O
It is true that Barros was in Karadima’s group of young people.,O
"But let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.”",O
“This is what I can say with sincerity.,O
Barros will remain there if I don’t find a way to condemn him.,O
I cannot condemn him if I don’t have – I don’t say proof – but evidence.,O
And there are many ways to get evidence.,O
Is that clear?”,O
This “contrite” papal apology didn’t fly well even with the regular news reporters.,O
"Indeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the “pain” of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand.",O
CBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused.,O
"Greg Burke, the pope’s press officer, confirmed that “no papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.”",O
Who is Barros?,O
Some may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop.,O
At the time it didn’t draw much attention from the English language press – mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods.,O
"But despite the pope’s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge.",O
"He is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the ‘80s and ‘90s.",O
"In fact – and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press – Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima.",O
"Juan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy – both in their teens at the time – “would lie down on the priest’s [Karadima’s] bed, one resting his head at the man’s shoulder, another sitting near his feet.",O
"The priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev.",O
"Juan Barros watched.” Cruz, now a 51-year-old “gay” journalist, told The Associated Press, “Barros was there, and he saw it all.”",O
Things are a bit different now.,O
Neither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people.,O
"The media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment – none of which received any response.",O
Fr.,O
"Peter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, “We’re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded.",O
We need a bishop who’s credible.”,O
"The problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis’s C9 inner council.",O
"Allegations against Karadima – that went back to 1962 – had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Errázuriz.",O
"Even the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,",O
"“Hamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque.",O
"His wife confided in a priest, who told Errázuriz in 2006.",O
"When a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled.",O
"Again, Errázuriz refused to take action against Karadima.”",O
The pope’s claim that there is “no evidence” flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case – a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican’s own rules for determining credibility in such cases.,O
"While Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible.",O
"After a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims “truthful and reliable”.",O
"Victims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima’s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Errázuriz’s successor and collaborator.",O
"As for Barros’s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning.",O
"In a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship.",O
“I saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other.,O
The groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros’ genitals”.,O
Barros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima.,O
"Hamilton confirmed this saying, “I saw how Barros watched it all.”",O
And the matter didn’t end in 2010.,O
Which brings us to Francis Bergoglio’s own record in this area.,O
"The pope claimed “I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,” but this claim is not supported by the reality.",O
"Indeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at “safeguarding” young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up.",O
"In the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that “reveals the [Chilean] bishops’ concern about Francis naming a Karadima protégé, Bishop Juan Barros.” Just days before the pope’s “calumny” comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno.",O
“[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.”,O
"The letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops’ conference, said, “Thank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros.",O
"I understand what you’re telling me and I’m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you’ve had to undergo.” The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had “encouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.”",O
There can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Errázuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima’s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council.,O
"And even if he didn’t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role.",O
"Francis further appointed Cardinal Errázuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogotá, Colombia in June 2014.",O
"Since 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes.",O
Danneels’s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope’s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse.,O
"At the end of a long career as Europe’s leading “liberal” Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a protégé bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew.",O
In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges.,O
The cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should “ask forgiveness” for his own role in the scandal.,O
"Before the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups.",O
"Maciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ.",O
"Crucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders.",O
His reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers.,O
"A senior member of the Vatican’s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, “This Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world...",O
"There have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.”",O
These reforms – and removals – have ceased entirely under Francis.,O
Inzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.,O
"Following an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest’s penalty to a “lifetime of prayer,” with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children.",O
"The uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized.",O
"As for Ratzinger/Benedict’s procedural reforms, rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well, placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001.",O
"A tribunal of bishops, requested by his own sex abuse commission, was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases, famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal Müller who was soon to be dismissed.",O

Man who sold ammo to Las Vegas gunman speaks out,O
© Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. Douglas Haig,O
New documents reveal the name of the second person of interest in the Las Vegas shooting.,O
"Police believe Douglas Haig may have conspired with gunman Stephen Paddock, but it's unclear if he's still under investigation.",O
Haig sold Paddock ammunition the month before the October attack that killed 58 people dead and wounded hundreds of others.,O
"Mandalay Bay hotel staff had numerous run-ins with Vegas gunman: companyLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had lost money, been depressed, sheriff says",O
"Haig was contacted one day after the attack, after investigators found an Amazon box with his address on it inside Paddock's hotel room, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal.",O
But Haig says he had no idea what Paddock was planning to do when he met him just a few weeks before the massacre.,O
Haig says he sold Paddock 720 rounds of ammunition from Haig's home gun business.,O
"""I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,"" he said.",O
"""He told me exactly what he wanted.",O
"I handed him a box with the ammunition in it, and he paid me and he left.""",O
"The rounds he sold are called ""tracer ammunition"" – bullets that leave a visible trail when fired.",O
"""He said he was going to go put on a light show.",O
"And I can't remember whether he said for or with his friends, but that's what he did say,"" Haig said.",O
"But newly released search warrant records filed last fall by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department say Haig ""may have conspired with Stephen Paddock to commit murder with a deadly weapon.""",O
Haig strongly denies that.,O
"""I felt that they were hoping that they could find a connection between myself and Paddock, that would go back showing that I supplied him with most of his ammunition, possibly even some firearms,"" Haig said.",O
"""They're not gonna find it.",O
"I talked to the guy three times.""",O
"It's unclear whether Haig is still a person of interest, but he was the only one mentioned by name in the search warrant, other than Marilou Danley - Paddock's girlfriend.",O
Authorities have since said they don't plan to bring charges against Danley.,O
Las Vegas gunman's motive still unknown,O
"Haig does not blame himself, but within weeks of the massacre, he still decided to shut down his business.",O
"Why didn't I pick this up?""",O
he said.,O
"Haig, represented by his Phoenix attorneys Marc Victor and Andrew Marcantel, has not been charged.",O
His attorneys say he continues to cooperate with investigators.,O
"CBS News reached out to the FBI and other authorities involved, but none will comment on an active investigation.",O

Lawyer: Ammo dealer saw nothing suspicious in Vegas gunman,O
"Douglas Haig had no reason to believe Stephen Paddock would launch the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, attorney Marc Victor said.",O
He said Haig wishes he could have figured out the intentions of Paddock but defends the sale of ammunition as legal.,O
"""He wishes there was some clue that could have identified him,"" Victor said.",O
"""There was just nothing.""",O
"Meanwhile, the coroner in Las Vegas started releasing redacted autopsy records about the 58 people killed in the mass shooting at an outdoor concert.",O
Records relating to Paddock were not being provided.,O
The records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal.,O
"Haig was named as a ""person of interest"" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting.",O
"The documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest, and officials haven't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation.",O
Victor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and doesn't believe they have communicated since.,O
"Las Vegas police and officials with the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation.",O
"A law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting.",O
The official spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to disclose case information.,O
Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.,O
Haig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock.,O
"He also told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock.",O
"""I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,"" he said of Paddock.",O
"The ammunition sale took place at Haig's home in Mesa, because he didn't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show.",O
Victor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig's house and bore his client's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched.,O
It's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack.,O
The lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client wasn't unusual.,O
"Robert Spitzer, an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment, said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual.",O
Only six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check.,O
"Arizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement, nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions.",O
"""If you are in the business of selling anything, you are usually happy to make the sale, and there's nothing that says you need to write down this person's name or report the sale,"" said Spitzer, who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland.",O
"Victor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times, though he hasn't talked to them in months.",O
Haig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn.,O
Records show Haig also owns Specialized Military Ammunition LLC.,O
"The company's website says it sold tracer and incendiary ammunition but is now ""closed indefinitely.""",O
"Haig's name was blacked out in the more than 270 pages of search warrant records released by a Nevada judge to the AP, but remained on one page of documents provided to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.",O
The newspaper published the name online.,O
"Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish later ordered the full document not be published without redactions, but she acknowledged she couldn't order the newspaper to retract the name.",O

Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge,O
"(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.",O
A criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.,O
"The bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says.",O
"The FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said.",O
"Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said.",O
"Police say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others.",O
More than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.,O
Investigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.,O
Douglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.,O
"Haig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings.",O
He is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.,O
"The maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.",O
"Haig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment.",O
"CNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case.",O
"""My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,"" he told KNXV.",O
The complaint,O
Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest,O
"In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.",O
"Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.",O
Haig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.,O
"Victor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock ""was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.""",O
"But in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.",O
It's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.,O

"Having followed Douthat and Faggioli’s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.",O
"In his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis’s papacy thus far: his impact on the public’s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on “moral-theological controversies,” specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).",O

"Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of “continuity” with past popes, since doing so would assume that “Christianity at some point .",O
.,O
"was complete,” which Faggioli does not think is true.",O
"While I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy.",O
"To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce.",O
Advertisement,O
"However, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful.",O
"Just before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world.",O
"But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church’s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.",O
Advertisement,O
"It should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd.",O
"If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church?",O
"Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of “accommodation” Faggioli is calling for, writing that when “the people cannot cope” with God, they “bring him down into their own world,” and insist that “he must be the kind of God that [they need].” In other words, “Man is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.” To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf.",O
"Throughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.",O

"Throughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of “the flock.”",O

"At its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong.",O
"Of course not — that would be preposterous, as I’m sure Faggioli would agree.",O
"To pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries.",O

"FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976",O
"It was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church.",O
"And for those of us who’ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.",O
"Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.",O
"And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.",O
May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.,O
MJM,O
The Archbishop Speaks,O
Ladies and Gentlemen:,O
"As I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt’s introductory talk referenced above.]",O
"And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr.",O
Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.,O
"And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.",O
"As Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary.",O
It is very difficult to understand the situation today.,O
"My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome.",O
Why?,O
These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.,O
"They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians.",O
All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.,O
Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?,O
But we do not change.,O
We continue the Tradition.,O
"So why do they now say, as Mgr.",O
"(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, “you are out of communion with the Church.” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?",O
This is possible?,O
I do not understand.,O
Why?,O
I have done nothing.,O
I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.,O
Mgr.,O
"Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome.",O
Mgr.,O
"Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, “You must say this New Mass in all of your houses.”",O
I wonder why Mgr.,O
Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.,O
[2] He could have done so.,O
"For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries.",O
I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.,O
I do not destroy the Church.,O
And so I said to Mgr.,O
"Benelli, “No, I will not sign that writing.”",O
And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?,O
"When, then?",O
At the beginning of the Council?,O
"No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].",O
"In [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.",O
[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.,O
And what did these Instructions say?,O
The Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.,O
"The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.",O
"The Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.",O
"One day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.",O
"And even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.",O
Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.,O
"In 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.",O
"He wrote in his book, Il Santo, that “We [modernists]…want a reform in the Church…without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority…even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.”[4] “The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!",O
"And I think…well, here we are!",O
In this time!,O
"The reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.",O
"And all they say is “Obedience, obedience, obedience.”",O
"The Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [“the banner of revolution”].",O
One century before [the Council]!,O
"Thus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!",O
"As the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.",O
"There were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.",O
Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.,O
"The schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “…On Religious Tolerance” and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled “On Religious Freedom [Liberty].” When we read these two schemas, we thought, “This is impossible.",O
How is it we can receive two opposing theses?,O
One says we must not tolerate error.,O
"The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.” And so, we go into the meeting.",O
"Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.",O
He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.,O
But before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.,O
Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani?,O
Who is with Cardinal Bea?,O
The conservatives and the liberals.,O
"As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.",O
This historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.,O
Isn't it time for you to subscribe?,O
"And as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).",O
This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.,O
"That is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.",O
And now this is public.,O
Nobody has been able to refute the publication.,O
"Now, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.",O
That is not true.,O
Why?,O
"Because when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council.",O
It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.,O
"Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform.",O
"We can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council.",O
They know that.,O
And I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.,O
"Even if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!",O
"For example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom.",O
I have heard this (personally) twice.,O
The first time I was in Columbia.,O
"When I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia.",O
[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.,O
They changed it.,O
They removed this article.,O
I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.,O
"He said to the people, “even though we remove this article we remain Catholic.",O
"Then, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was “progress,” “humanity,” “evolution,” and all the hubris of a Freemason.",O
"But I will never…I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council.",O
Are you sure?,O
"Yes, sure.",O
It is evident.,O
"Now I said to the [Secretary], “As I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago.",O
The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.” (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.,O
The Valais is Catholic.,O
"And in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais – Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)",O
"And [the Secretary] said, “Yes, I am responsible for this change.” Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?",O
What is this for you?,O
"What do you say when you say “thy kingdom come” in your prayer, the Our Father?",O
"“Ah,” the Nuncio said to me, “Now it is impossible.” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?",O
"“Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.”",O
It is incredible.,O
"If we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world…",O
[missing audio...],O
The truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.,O
"We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.",O
We cannot say that.,O
We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].,O
And the change in the liturgy is very important.,O
It is very bad.,O
"One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy.",O
And democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.,O
That is not true.,O
It is impossible.,O
And our liturgy is the school of our Faith.,O
It is the first school of our Faith for all people.,O
I was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.,O
I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.,O
They can see what the priest does.,O
They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.,O
And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.,O
They know that.,O
That is very important.,O
Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.,O
The true liturgy is hierarchical.,O
Why?,O
"Because we have God, the priest, and then the people.",O
That is hierarchy.,O
When we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.,O
But now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.,O
"The priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal.",O
That is a new liturgy.,O
"That is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life.",O
We need the authority of God.,O
We need the Real Presence of God on our altar.,O
We need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice.,O
"So, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar.",O
That is the school of our Faith.,O
"And slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates.",O
It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].,O
I do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.,O
"But perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].",O
"Recently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence.",O
"But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith.",O
"Last year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers.",O
This one priest came from France.,O
His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.,O
The uncle had nine children.,O
"The Bishop said to the new priest, “Now you can say Mass for your uncle.",O
"Now you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.” The new priest said, “No, never.” Why?",O
It is not useful to say Mass for the dead?,O
"“No, no, it is impossible.",O
They are already in heaven.” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.,O
"They are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything.",O
Another example.,O
"Recently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris.",O
"One of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student.",O
They told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.,O
"I asked them, “Why do you come to see me?” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris.",O
There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.,O
"We cannot remain in this seminary.” So, they came to meet me.",O
They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.,O
They asked for admittance to Econe.,O
And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.,O
But that is a new religion.,O
It is a Protestant religion.,O
It is a big mystery.,O
There are many proposed theological answers.,O
I cannot subscribe to all of them.,O
Some say the pope is not responsible.,O
"Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible.",O
"Perhaps, I don’t know.",O
Some say there are two popes [(a body double)].,O
"Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave).",O
We do not know.,O
"And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.",O
"Now, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry.",O
"No, you cannot say that.",O
"But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope.",O
Illegitimate.,O
I don’t know.,O
It is a mystery I cannot understand.,O
"But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that.",O
This pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.,O
"Well, there they are.",O
They are the men who destroy the Church.,O
We must show where they are.,O
"I do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.",O
And I have these experiences every day.,O
I visit many countries.,O
I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.,O
"Then I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference.",O
Many people came.,O
Many people are confused.,O
What is happening in the Church?,O
They are anxious.,O
But many people say that we disobey.,O
Disobey?,O
Obedience is relative.,O
It is not absolute.,O
"It is relative to the good, but not to the evil.",O
We cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.,O
We cannot obey.,O
It is clear.,O
"And I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad.",O
"The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist.",O
"And so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives.",O
They are modernists.,O
"Whereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative.",O
"So, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.",O
"And we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist.",O
That is a fact.,O
That is impossible.,O
How can they do that?,O
I do not know.,O
I have not spent my whole life in Rome.,O
"I do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State.",O
And I know that very well.,O
We must pray.,O
We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.,O
They lose the faith.,O
They cannot go into the church.,O
They abandon the faith.,O
You know that many priests have abandoned the faith.,O
Many priests have gotten married.,O
And many sisters have abandoned their congregations.,O
It is a pity.,O
And it is everywhere.,O
"I was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress.",O
"Cardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.",O
You cannot go to that Mass.,O
This is a fact.,O
They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.,O
They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.,O
[applause],O
This change is not accidental.,O
It is not superficial.,O
It is very deep.,O
Very bad.,O
It is against our faith.,O
"And so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome.",O
From Rome we expect only the good.,O
"We do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass.",O
We need this adoration.,O
We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.,O
"Because all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass.",O
"It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.",O
He is King because he is God.,O
He is the Son of God.,O
"So, He is King by His nature.",O
This is essential.,O
"And so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth.",O
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.,O
Jesus Christ is God.,O
That is a fundamental truth of our Faith.,O
And it all depends on this Truth.,O
And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].,O
They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.,O
They are afraid of the truth.,O
That is very bad.,O
And it is the same in Rome.,O
"I think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth].",O
"When I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr.",O
Benelli told me he visits the pope every day.,O
"He said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting.",O
"Immediately, he said, he would be going.",O
"So, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?",O
Because they are afraid.,O
Meanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.,O
"Here, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:",O
"Cardinal Villot said, “We are afraid if Msgr.",O
He is a mysterious man.,O
We cannot give a definition of the man.,O
"He expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite.",O
Some part of him will speak the truth.,O
Another part of him is open to error.,O
Very curious.,O
And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] “you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.,O
"You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.",O
"And so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope.",O
It is impossible to admit me.,O
And I know the pope very well!,O
"When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year.",O
"And during those eleven years, I met Msgr.",O
Montini.,O
"He received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope.",O
"But, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: “No, impossible!",O
You must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.” But I cannot do that.,O
"So, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations.",O
"For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain.",O
Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.,O
And why?,O
Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?,O
They know that.,O
But still they come.,O
"I ask them, why do you come to Econe?",O
You know our situation.,O
"They say, “Yes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests.",O
We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.,O
"And so, we are Coming to Econe.”",O
"And as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here.",O
We have very good young men.,O
I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.,O
"In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest.",O
But these young men refuse to become protestants.,O
They refuse to become modernist.,O
They ask to become true priests.,O
And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.,O
"So, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties.",O
"I think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries.",O
And we have confidence in God.,O
"Since I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us.",O
"Because it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself.",O
"We now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York.",O
"In Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters).",O
And I am building a seminary in Switzerland.,O
"So, I have confidence.",O
It is impossible for the Church to change its tradition.,O
The tradition of twenty centuries.,O
The Church is tradition.,O
It is not revolution.,O

Dr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.,O
"“The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium,” wrote Cordes.",O

Marx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference.,O
"As LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said “yes,” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.",O
This “encouragement” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “liturgical” recognition of their union.,O
"But “how this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,” is “another question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.”",O
"After Catholic News Agency’s initial report on Marx’s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.",O
"The cardinal’s office sent CNA “a request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”",O
Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx’s proposal.,O
"“There is no love – no charity – without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,” he wrote.",O
"“Creating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.”",O
"“There are two principles we need to remember,” Chaput wrote.",O
This emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.,O
"“This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,” he explained.",O

"SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case",O
"The press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.",O
"Pope Francis received a victim’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.",O
"The fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has “zero tolerance” for sex abuse and cover-ups.",O
Now it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.,O
"The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, “had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.”",O
"“But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to…Osorno.”",O
"The article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.",O
"The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.",O
"While the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.",O
"The website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.",O
"Marco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.",O
"Without naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:",O
"“It was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.",O
The nuncio has prepared the triad [the “terna” or list of three candidates].,O

"But I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.",O
He responds little to the necessary criteria.,O
"But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions.”",O
"Whatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.",O
Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.,O
"Even while “apologising” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, “You, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven’t seen any, because they haven’t come forward.”",O
"“In the case of Barros it’s been observed, it’s been studied; there’s no evidence.",O
The best thing to do if someone believes it’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.”,O
"The AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley, the pope’s “top abuse advisor,” with the letter to deliver to the pope.",O
"Marie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican’s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, “When we gave him [O’Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.",O
"On the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.",O
"In fact, unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has, as of this writing, remained silent – comes forward and says that he didn’t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.",O
"And this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.",O
"As Winfield writes,",O
"“The revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].",O
"More recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.",O
"Vatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn’t.”",O

How are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?”,O
What reply did Bergoglio give?,O
"About Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.",O
"And from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.",O
We did not find anything of that.,O
This is the response.”,O
"He added, “In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.”",O
"But Ricca’s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.",O
"They include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.",O
"It was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by “numerous bishops, priests, religious and laity” in Uruguay[6].",O
"In fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio’s normal procedures.",O
"And in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you’re caught.",O
"The pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio’s policy since long before he came on the international scene.",O
"He has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.",O
Perhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.,O
"Indeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.",O
“Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis…”,O
"Though the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.",O
On their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn’t interested in hearing from victims.,O
"“In Pope Francis’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.”",O
"“All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.",O
"The site says that “in addition to Bergoglio’s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.”",O
"In fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.",O
"Weeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, “In my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.” Francis added that he agreed with the “zero tolerance” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse.",O
"It was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope’s attention.",O
"One, known to the press only as “Gabriel,” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, “who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation.",O
"So far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.”",O
"In case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope’s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, “A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi’s trial, three men ransacked the survivor’s apartment and beat him.” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.",O
"Ten years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, “Gabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.",O
An employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.”,O
The group surmises that it was Bergoglio’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.,O
"In 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “media campaign” and claimed that the Grassi case was “different” from other accusations.",O
During his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “never let go” of his hand.,O
"In 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “Gabriel,” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.",O
It is arguable that even the members of the so-called “San Gallen Mafia” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter’s throne were used by him.,O
But he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.,O
"Looking carefully at the infamous “Who am I to judge” comment, this was clear early on.",O
"Recall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.",O
"But perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.",O
Journalists must submit their questions well in advance.),O
Read his full answer carefully:,O
"I see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for “sins from youth”, for example, and then publish them.",O
"They are not crimes, right?",O
Crimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.,O
"No, sins.",O
"But if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.",O
"When we confess our sins and we truly say, “I have sinned in this”, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.",O
This is important: a theology of sin.,O
Many times I think of Saint Peter.,O
"He committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.",O
We have to think a great deal about that.,O
"But, returning to your question more concretely.",O
"In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.",O
This is the first question.,O
"Then, you spoke about the gay lobby.",O
So much is written about the gay lobby.,O
I still haven’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “gay” on it.,O
They say there are some there.,O
"I believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.",O
This one is not good.,O
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: “no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society”.",O
"The problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.",O
"For me, this is the greater problem.",O
Thank you so much for asking this question.,O
Many thanks.,O
One of the pope’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.,O
"He starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.",O
This was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “gay”.,O
"Not “homosexual,” not “same-sex attracted,” but “gay,” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement’s linguistic manipulations.",O
"In this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “disagree” with Catholic teaching on sexuality.",O
There are very few “conservative” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.,O
"This astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.",O
"“The problem is not having this tendency.” Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.",O
"A few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:",O
A mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.,O
But Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.,O
Lying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.,O
"Thomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.",O
"Habitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.",O
"This of course means that a person whose “orientation,” as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.",O
He tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.,O
"It was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.",O
"Human beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.",O
"This is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don’t see it coming.",O
"The first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.",O
We therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.,O
"Sociologists talk about the concept of the “high trust society,” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately.",O
This is the way societies disintegrate.,O
"It has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.",O
Are we seeing it already?,O
Are we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?,O
With Cardinal Marx and others promoting “blessings” for “same-sex unions” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?,O
I am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio’s support has completely dried up.,O
"Marie Collins, by no stretch even a “conservative” Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has “definitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope” in Francis.",O
"“All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now…and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,” she told the National Catholic Reporter.",O
"There is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.",O
Notes:,O
[1] “Not one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.,O
Is that clear?”,O
"[2] The book “The Dictator Pope” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.",O
"It is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.",O
[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world… and drives the rest of us spare.,O
"Italians care about getting a general picture of what’s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.",O
"[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission’s recommendations.",O
The time limit of the Commission’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.,O
"[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope’s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.",O
"Sandro Magister reported after the “Who am I to judge” comment, “Before the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly.",O
"He had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.”",O

PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study,O
"Scientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050, but the phase has almost no effect on global warming.",O
Physicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “grand minimum” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.,O
"“The cooldown… [is] a periodic event during which the Sun’s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that “the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun’s magnetic field.”",O
"The study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum.",O
"According to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the “Maunder Minimum,” or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice.",O
"However, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming.",O
"“The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” they said, adding, “After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.”",O
The study estimated that the Sun’s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.,O
"As a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part.",O
“Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.,O
"We can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change,” said Lubin.",O

"Yore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.",O
The Pope’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.,O
"Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was “told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.”",O

"The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.",O
Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “extremely dangerous.”,O
Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.,O
The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.,O
"Pope Francis received the victim’s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis’s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.",O
The Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna – the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.,O
Expectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission.,O
"And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don’t match his tough stances on abuse.",O
"Four members of the commission had met with Cardinal O’Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.",O
"It was at the meeting with O’Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O’Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.",O
"Yore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops’ conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored.",O
"Further, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified — including the letter’s author Juan Carlos — to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.",O
Cruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.,O
"And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O’Malley.",O
"Cruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope’s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.",O
"“To hear him talk about us that way,” Cruz said, “calling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.”",O
"Scicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.",O
"“This leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,” Yore said.",O
"“This is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.”",O
She said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.,O
"“So I don’t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,” she said.",O
"Yore said that given the Church’s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees.",O

"In the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.",O
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,O
A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.,O
Cardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.,O
"Now, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.",O
The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:,O
"For Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.",O
"The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.",O
"Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.",O
But parents can bless their children.,O
"The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them.",O
[...],O
What kind of hope is connected with a blessing?,O
"With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.",O
"With the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought.",O
[…],O
"The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.",O
[…],O
"But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.",O
"Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.",O
"This blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!",O
"What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an “individual case”!",O
"The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: “Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” [Isaiah 5:20]",O
Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing?,O
"If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “honey,” the cucumbers still remain sour!",O
Even blessing bishops cannot change that.,O
"Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it.",O
That seems to catch on these days.,O
"For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!",O
"Nevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well.",O

"According to the Tagespost report, Cardinal Müller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a “theocentric humanism.” He said the “submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions” is a “suicidal modernization” that denies mankind the Truth of God.","Name_Calling,Labeling"

"He stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be “read in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.” In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a “continuity with the Magisterium of the Church.” He also said: “The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.",Black-and-White_Fallacy

"In astronomy, a light-year is a commonly used unit to measure distance, but some astronomers prefer to use a unit called the parsec.",O
"When referring to something larger, they use kiloparsecs, which are equal to 1,000 parsecs, and megaparsecs, equal to one million parsecs.",O
"The Milky Way measures about 100,000 light-years or 30 kiloparsecs across.",O
"This may seem large, but it is rather small when compared to other galaxies.",O
"The Andromeda Galaxy has an approximate diameter of 220,000 light years, which is more than double of that of the Milky Way.",O
It is the largest galaxy in the Local Cluster.,O
"If it were bright enough, the Andromeda Galaxy would appear larger than the Moon in the sky (as depicted above), even with it being much farther away.",O
"The galaxy is 9.5 trillion kilometers away from Earth, whereas the Moon is only 384,400 kilometers (238,900 mi) away—that should give you a better understanding of just how big the galaxy really is.",O

"Solar Storm Will Strike Earth Tonight, ‘Weak Power Grid Fluctuations’ Possible",O
The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts an aurora could light up the sky above areas in the United State including Michigan and Maine.,O
"A solar storm, which occurred Monday, is expected to strike Earth tonight.",O
"On Monday, the sun spit out a slew of charged particles in a moderate solar flare.",O
These particles are now making their way towards Earth.,O
"The planet’s magnetic field will block most of the particles, but some will make it into Earth’s atmosphere.",O
The particles collect at the north and south poles and interact with atmospheric gases to create the aurora borealis or the Northern Lights.,O
And some say this show could be quite spectacular.,O
"Solar flares have been known to cause power grid failures, but it looks like we’ll only get the light show this time.",O
"Although a grid failure is possible, it is unlikely.",O
"According to Seeker, the forecast calls for a high probability of a G-1 or “minor” storm, which could strengthen to a G-2 or “moderate” storm depending on how the stream of particles hit the Earth.",O
"Geomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale, with G at the bottom, R in the middle, and S as the most severe.",O
Forecasts now say the particles will give our planet a glancing blow.,O
"Although this storm has been categorized as “G-1,” which means it is minor, it could still cause some havoc down on Earth.",O
Solar flares and particle ejections are associated with sunspots — dark areas on the sun’s surface — that host intense magnetic activity.,O
"As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross, NASA stated, this can cause a sudden energy explosion, also known as a solar flare.",O
"This sends radiation out into space, and that radiation can be hurled toward the Earth.",O
"G1-level storms, such as Monday’s, may affect migratory animals, and can cause “weak power grid fluctuations.” The barrage of particles may even have a minor impact on satellites.",O
But it doesn’t look like there will be any serious damage to the power grid because of this storm as of right now.,O
"Of course, that’s not to say the storms are insignificant — many are large enough to swallow and entire continent here on Earth — so watching one breathe its dying gasps is still a special sight.",Loaded_Language
A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes,O
"You don’t have to look far for fresh news about Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter these days, but Neptune doesn’t always get the same kind of attention.",O
The big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun — since we don’t count Pluto as a planet anymore — and it hasn’t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others.,O
"Thankfully the Hubble Space Telescope hasn’t lost interest in the distant planet, because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet.",O
"Storms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals, a bit like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.",O
"However, unlike Jupiter’s centuries-old storm, Neptune’s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating.",O
"The planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur.",O
"“We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,” Agustín Sánchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains.",O
“It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.”,O
The observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it’s the very first time one of Neptune’s storms has been observed in such a way.,O
It also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die.,O
"“It looks like we’re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it’s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,” said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says.",O
“Their dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator.,O
"We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.”",O
"But this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn’t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet’s weather habits.",O

"The diocese’s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative.",O
"The official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day.",O
As is explained in the article:,O
St. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love.,O
"In many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day.",O
People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.,O
"Paul Stütz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples “offers an occasion to express love.”",O
"“The blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.” At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor.",O
As Stütz reports:,O
We give out that universally available blessing.,O
"There, we have nothing to forbid,” says Harant.",O
"As the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250.",O
"“We thus stress the high value of relationships,” explains Lehner.",O
"As the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: “This offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations – also by lesbians and homosexuals.” Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing.",O
"“Here with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.” The pastoral assistant adds that “God is love.",O
There are no restrictions.”,O
The Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish.,O
The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to “receive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.”,O
"The KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:",O
"It would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed.",O
"Moreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group – also called “Rainbow Pastoral.” As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called “Queer Church Services” (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish.",O
It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.,O
"Similar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level.",O
"As LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals.",O
"Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg Bätzing.",O
"Additionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples.",O
Father Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years.,O
He also conducts church services for homosexuals.,O
Kath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests.,O
"As an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference.",O
This moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics.,O
"Mathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter.",O
"As he sees it, “the bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,” where they will have to show their colors.",O

Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy.,O
"The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests.",O
Here’s a look what drove the panel’s creation and what to expect in the future.,O
What is Pope Francis’ commission on sexual abuse?,O
"Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it.",O
"O’Malley was not only a member of the pope’s “G9” group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie “Spotlight.”",O
"The revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them.",O
"When he created the commission, Francis said: “The commission’s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.”",O
Why is it being renewed now?,O
"After the commission’s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy.",O
O’Malley returns as chief.,O
"New members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, ""reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,” the Vatican said.",O
What did the first commission achieve?,O
"The Vatican has said it “worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.”",O
What didn’t it do?,O
Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.,O
"Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior, those strictures were not enough, O’Malley said in 2014.",O
"“There are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,” he said.",O

"So far, five states have passed “red flag” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “dangerous” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “red flag” law.",O

And it’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners.,O
"This report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws.",O
“The city’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘extreme risk protection order.’,O
"“The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side.",O
"“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”",O
"“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.",O
The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.,O
"“In this case, the man refused to comply.",O
"Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”",O
"“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.",O
"“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.",O
“‘There’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.,O
"The “erpos” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt.",O
"Eric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.",O
"“The confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.”",O
See the report here:,O
Seattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law,O
A few observations are in order here:,O
"Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.",O
"Secondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.",O
That means nothing.,O
Known for what?,O
The report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.,O
"Plus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.",O
The report says “he had been intimidating people.” How?,O
No specifics except to say he was “staring” at people.,O
It seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.,O
"Sixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”",O
That the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.,O
"Even when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.",O
I go into the “mental health” trap in more detail in this column:,O
Trump Set To Enact More Gun Control,O
"“Mental health” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.",O
"Now, it is the “pro-gun” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.",O
Kris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.,O
He is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.,O
He wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “red flag” laws:,O
The seizure of guns without any hearing at all.,O
The laws all contain an “ex parte” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.,O
This is the quintessential denial of due process.,O
The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one’s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.,O
"This confiscation is “temporary,” but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.",O
Based on the testimony of one unrelated person.,O
The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.,O
But “family member” is defined to include “former dating partners” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.,O
"So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.",O
Using a very low standard of proof.,O
That’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.,O
"In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.",O
"Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.",O
"But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials.",O
"Rather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.",O
What kind of evidence?,O
Things like the “reckless storage” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.,O
Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.,O
"The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.",O
"Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.",O
"To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.",O
"Freedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.",O
"And while you are at it, don’t overlook the federal Congress.",O
See the video here:,O
P.S.,O
One more time I want to remind readers that self-defense—including defense against tyrannical government—is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.,O
"For anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.",O
I urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “To Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.”,O
"Mark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical.",O
I know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.,O
THEY ARE WRONG.,O
Our book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense.,O
I don’t know of another book like it.,O
I urge you to order one for yourself and one (at least) for your friends and kinfolk.,O

"I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.",O
"It’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.",O
Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.,O
"Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.",O
MJM,O
Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?,O
We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.,O
"Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.",O
How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.,O
"So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.",O
But this is not what we see.,O
"There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.",O
"“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?",O
"Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?",O
"If it is a deception, why participate in it?",O
"In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.",O
Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.,O
"But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.",O
We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.,O
"There’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.",O
Why did you resign?,O
Ratzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”,O
"If you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?",O
"Ratzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”",O
Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?,O
"Ratzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”",O
And where did this “emeritus” business come from?,O
Does it have any precedent in Catholic history?,O
What does it mean canonically and doctrinally?,O
Ratzinger: “…”,O
Doesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?,O
Ratzinger: “…”,O
"A few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.",O
"Five years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.",O
"And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.",O
"You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.",O
"And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.",O
Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?,O
"I have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.",O
I think we made the mistake of believing the press.,O
We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.,O
"This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.",O
"Frings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.",O
"After this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.",O
"Cardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:",O
"“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.",O
"Frings, Archbishop of Cologne.",O
"Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.",O
"Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.",O
Despite a reply by Card.,O
"Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique.",O
"“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.",O
“Card.,O
"Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.”",O
"It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.",O
"In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:",O
"The duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.",O
"This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.",O
Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.,O
"Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.",O
"It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.",O
"His was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.",O
"And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.",O
"Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?",O
Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?,O
Precious few.,O
"Why did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?",O
"Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?",O
"Indeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.",O
He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.,O
"Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.",O
Is this why he resigned?,O
"Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?",O
Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.,O
"Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.",O
"Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.",O
"By 2012, this had proved impossible.",O
I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.,O
They were esteemed academic colleagues.,O
They were brothers of the episcopate.,O
They were members of the club.,O
"Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.",O
Why wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?,O
Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal?,O
"When, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.",O
"In an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.",O
The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.,O
"This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.",O
This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.,O
Why was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?,O
Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.,O
"After openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.",O
Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.,O
"But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.",O
Nor was he removed from places of influence.,O
Far from it.,O
In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.,O
"In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.",O
Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.,O
"As Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,",O
"Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.",O
"But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.",O
"(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)",O
"Excuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.",O
Doesn’t anyone else want to know this?,O
Don’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?,O
Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?,O
"What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?",O
"My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.",O
The end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”,O
The New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.,O
There’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.,O
"By playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.",O
It created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.,O
"And just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.",O
As it had to.,O
"They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.",O
And their New Church is the only one left.,O
"We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.",O
"One of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.",O
"For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.",O
"This pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.",O

The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.,O
Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.,O
"Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy.",O
"Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president.",O
But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.,O

CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:,O
"On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.",O
"He “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added.",O
Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.,O
"The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service.",O
"Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP.",O
Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.,O
"While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC.",O

"As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.",O
"Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.",O
"Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.",O
"The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.",O

Abid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors.,O
"At that time, he filed forms “under penalty of perjury” that two houses were needed as “my spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.”",O

"Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain lack of appetite and in some cases internal and external bleeding, according to WHO.",O
Where did it originate from?,O
Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks.,O

The other outbreak in Yambuku in Zaire in what is now DR Congo.,O
"The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.",O
Why is it so dangerous?,O
The average Ebola fatality rate is about 50 percent.,O
But the rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in recent outbreaks.,O
"There is as of yet no proven cure available for Ebola, though some vaccines are being tested.",O
"Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems.",O
It is not known why some people recover from Ebola while most succumb to the disease.,O
Why does it keep coming back?,O
"The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.",O
"In Africa where most outbreaks happen, particular species of fruit bats are considered natural hosts for the Ebola virus.",O
"Infected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans, or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat.",O
"The family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak, a two-year-old child, hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak.",O
"An estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research.",O
"The virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments.",O

Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “Regime Change” In Iran,O
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge,O
It appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying.,O
"The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.",O
"The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.",O
"It deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region.",O
–Free Beacon,O
"“The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,” SSG writes in the paper.",O
“This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months” it further claims as an argument to push a “regime change” policy.,O
"For now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “hardline ruling regime.”",O
"“The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,” Hanson said.",O
“But they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government.,O
That is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.”,O
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change",O
"“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.",O
"“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.",O
"It’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”",O
The source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”,O
"“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”",O
"That said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months:",O

"“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.",O

The Washington Free Beacon reports:,O
"The Trump administration is examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.",O
The three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.,O
"The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009.",O

"Well, why is that?",O

One of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of “autonomy” of monasteries.,Repetition
"Many of the headlines crowed: “Vatican confirms nuns’ autonomy,” or similar.",Repetition
"In fact, the word “autonomy” is the key to understanding this whole thing.",Repetition
It appears in the document 16 times and “autonomous” 30 times.,Repetition
"In fact, “autonomy” is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery’s viability.",Repetition
This emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the “fruitful” post-conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out… for… some reason…,Repetition
"Monastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that, having the requisites for real autonomy of life, was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law.",Repetition
"18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns, it must presuppose a real autonomy of life, that is, the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions (vocational, formative, governmental, relational, liturgical, economic ...).",Repetition
"In this case, an autonomous monastery is alive and vital.",Repetition
"43 Autonomy of life, a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy, must be constantly verified by the Federal President who, when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life, must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission.",Repetition
"67 Affiliation [with another monastery, appointed by the Vatican] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised.",Repetition
"no longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See.",Repetition
"At the same time, this document is redefining the term “autonomous” to exclude independence.",Repetition
What got no mention in the brief press interest was the document’s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate “autonomy” they will be granted little in the way of powers of self-governance.,Repetition
"And given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery, it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism, or even to the Catholic Faith, a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time.",Repetition
Funny you should mention autonomy: Bioethics and the dissolution of “unviable” monasteries,Repetition
It’s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be “autonomy”.,Repetition
"This is the world, the language, of Bioethics, applied utilitarianism, also called “Principlism” after its three bioethical criteria of “justice, beneficence[6] and autonomy” – it is a patient’s ability to demonstrate his “autonomy” or “quality of life,[7]” either currently or potentially, that decides his fate.",Repetition
Medical treatment (which legally includes food and water) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle.,Repetition

"When the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life, one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails.",Loaded_Language

Once a lack of autonomy has been established…,Repetition
"55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible, helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery.",Repetition

Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders,O
The Francis Vatican’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.,O
Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.,O
It has no “use” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand.,O
There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.,O
One aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.,O
The world does not understand it or want it.,O
"Therefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it.",O
"So when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .",O
"Italian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, “Rejoice and be glad… but not if you’re a cloistered contemplative.”",O
"Unfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed.",O
"Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.",O
"The new document issued last week, “Cor orans,” is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules – 289 of them!",O
– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.,O
One odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:,O
"“A monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.” (emphasis added)",O
Wait… its “usefulness”?,O
"I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, “According to what specific criteria is a monastery’s ‘usefulness’ actually determined?”",O
One can’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.,O
"A house that could prove to the secularists that it was “useful” – that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue.",O
Those which were purely contemplative – a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed.,O
Rupture?,O
What rupture?,O
The first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.,O
"In the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a “hermeneutic of continuity” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950.",O
"The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1].",O
"In fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points.",O
"As a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.",O
"But of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:",O
"Yes, that’s what it said.",O
How do you know?,O
Because we’re telling you it has.”,O
This is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; “Nothing to see here.,O
"And if you say there is, you’re the problem.”",O
"It’s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they’ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren’t any.",O
"After all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.",O
Why would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?,O
Let’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.,O
"This is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US.",O
Apparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “mandated” by “the Council”.,O
Independence,O
But that word does not mean what they think it means.,O
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.",O
"When an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.",O
"As we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:",O
overcome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.,O
"Federation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.",O
Note the change: “independent” is replaced with “isolated[5].” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.,O
"She said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful.",O
"She didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants.",O
"She also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation’s leadership.",O
Was that monastery “isolated”?,O
Or just exercising lawful self-governance?,O
"The word “fidelity” appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.",O
"As we shall see, the document is what I’ve called above a “chopping block”.",O
"Vultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.",O
Note the language used here:,O
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.",O
It jogged a memory for me.,O
“Incapacity”… Where had I heard that language used before?,O
Most pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “Mental Capacity Act” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “reduced capacity” could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors.,O
"This set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a “new paradigm” of ethics replacing traditional “Hippocratic” or “Natural Law” medical ethics.",O
"Under this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live.",O
Health care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “guidelines” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.,O
These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.,O
"If the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.",O
"The NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.",O
In one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.,O
"The system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.",O
Keep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.,O
Federations as Vatican watchdogs,O
"Under this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation.",O
"Previously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.",O
The Federal Assembly:,O
"deals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;",O
More than just federations; a multi-tier system of control,O
"In other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “Conference” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc.",O
"This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things.",O
"Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!",O
"And finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:",O
"Confederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.",O
Broad powers,O
"Federations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.",O
"It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods.",O
"The legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.",O
"To keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.",O
"The communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.",O
The Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.,O
Financial incentives,O
"Given that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].",O
"Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.",O
"Article 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.",O
"Article 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:",O
"In the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.",O
"The economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.",O
Federations in charge of formation,O
"The Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.",O
"At the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.",O
"The formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.",O
"The President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.",O
Who makes new foundations and why?,O
"Throughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.",O
"Now, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.",O
"through the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.",O
"39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]",O
"A single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:",O
"In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.",O
The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.,O
Article 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”,O
"the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.",O
"a) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.",O
"b) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.",O
"c) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.",O
d) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.,O
One of these things is not like the others.,O
Did you notice?,O
"One criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards.",O
One aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.,O
If a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “loophole”.,O
Or it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.,O
"So, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?",O
"What, precisely, does the term “vitality” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?",O
"Is this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?",O
Like the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?,O
Does the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?,O
Or is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?,O
"The next article tells us, “It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “charism vitality”?",O
"It seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:",O
"Among the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].",O
You will be affiliated; resistance is futile…,O
Articles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of “incapacity” that is really just more of the second thing.,O
"54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.",O
How does affiliation work?,O
"Well, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:",O
"In these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery",O
It’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.,O
"Mariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.",O
"Mariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.",O
"60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.”",O
"Of course, this means it is the affiliating monastery’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, “neo-pelagian” postulants and novices.",O
~,O
This brings us to about article 155 of the document.,O
Part two to come.,O
_______________,O
"[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison.",O
"I’m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.",O
"[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the “conservative,” not Francis, who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “conservative” rubric of the “big umbrella” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.",O
[3] Just considering the numbers of course.,O
Leaving alone the doctrinal issues.,O
"[4] “The same Institute” means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.",O
"[6] “justice and beneficence” are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient",O
[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “quality” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.,O
"[8] Readers may think I’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “tens of millions” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head.",O
"Shortly after Carballo’s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running.",O
"Carballo was Francis’ very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.",O
[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.,O
I can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.,O

"The Vatican presents a choice: the world, or Christ.",Black-and-White_Fallacy

"Not only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism.",Loaded_Language
“This is a disaster.,Loaded_Language
"I contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for “Cor orans,” Cardinal João Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later.",Loaded_Language

Today I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious.,O
"They’re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position.",O
"These, I might add, are not what we would consider a “traditionalist” community.",O
They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language.,O
"For obvious reasons I can’t identify them, even to say what country they are in.",O
It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life.,O
Especially for Carmel.”,O
"In fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was “unprecedented,” 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders.",O
This is the programme:,O
They will not have sense.,O
"We need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.”",O
"After breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people’s “needs” are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses – people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts.",O
"Francis and Clare, Sts.",O
Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted.,O
“These contexts have changed.,O
"And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.”",O
“We must not be closed to new things.,O
"God is not static,” the cardinal said.",O
"“God is always new movement – of light, of heat, of demonstration.",O
He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.”,O
"The congregation’s Secretary, Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo, is reported as saying, “With this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.”",O
"Not the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II.",O
"Carballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: “A consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church – inserted in the world.",O
"Not in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,” he said.",O
"It is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:",O
"“After entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it.",O
There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: ‘The world is crucified to me and I to the world.’,O
"“Let us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us.",O
"The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: ‘No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.’ The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: ‘Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.’”",O
How Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila’s reform of Carmel,O
"Sister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform.",O
She acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.,O
"These are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, “ongoing formation” courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries.",O
Their funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.,O
"In 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr.",O
"Saverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers.",O
"This suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise.",O
"Maccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices.",O
"The push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistrà.",O
"Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by “ongoing formation” is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language.",O
"But for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa.",O
"Authentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, “are essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.”",O
"“They go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions.",O
"Each Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it’s own ‘feel.’ Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel.",O
Formation in common is something we’ve been fighting against for years.”,O
St. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place.,O
And now it’s going to be done to us.”,O
“As though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry.,O
"Our Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering.",O
"It will also help the monastery become ‘less viable’ because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.”",O
"Another requirement will be for a “religious assistant,” a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation.",O
Sister writes that this was rejected “years ago” by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference.,O
"Article 23 states, for instance, “In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery.",O
The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.”,O
"There are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse.",O
It’s all being done to us.,O
"In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and ‘choice’ for all, plus the ‘rights’ of women, here our rights are completely taken away.”",O
Another nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by “ongoing formation”.,O
"Judging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take “courses” together with novices from other monasteries.",O
"The content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of “experts” chosen by the Federation.",O
"Sister writes, “Cloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things.",O
Can they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.”,O
Apparently not.,O
"As I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself – that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do – starts by laying out its working premise:",O
"Pope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.",O
"Anyone who imagines that this document’s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or “conservative” communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention.",O
"They point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates.",O
"In the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph.",O
Its intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants – those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of “conservatives” – into the full post-conciliar “reform” instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s – or to close them.,O
"The thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way.",O
The whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.,O

Present Problems: Have got very old.,O

Possible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.”,O
"Given that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.",Loaded_Language
"As a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely “federated,” it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what “federations” are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.",Loaded_Language
"And perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order’s most desperate hour.","Exaggeration,Minimisation"
"Nothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites’ traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of “the path taken”.","Exaggeration,Minimisation"

"A tale of controlled, systematized extinction.",Loaded_Language
"Given this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.",Loaded_Language
"While there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.",Loaded_Language
What are these people smoking?,Doubt
"Perhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, “A ‘new dawn’ of what, exactly?” This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.",Repetition
The first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.,Loaded_Language
So many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the “conservatives” John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was “onside.” At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries.,Loaded_Language
A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?,O
"The meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] .",O
"The reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, “religious assistant” priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations.",O
"Today I’ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the “Federations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land” in Avila, February 2009.",O
Reconciled to managed extinction,O
"The report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, “infirmary Carmels,” nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.",O
"Solutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by “religious psychologists,” ever more powers handed to federations.",O
This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.,O
Very little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.,O
"Indeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.",O
The report from Great Britain notes: “18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.,O
There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.,O
Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.”,O
"Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.",O
"But in this situation, the “solution” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for “a completely new structure,” whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.",O
"The atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “forgetting the numbers” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “unity,” the creating of “links” and the “building of trust” and “dialogue” between communities.",O
"The report from Belgium – federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ageing” but under “possible solutions” says only, “We want to continue along the path we have begun.”",O
It is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].,O
It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.,O
"Federation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.",O
"This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.",O
"But the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: “Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.”",O
Path taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.,O
"From the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.",O
"Each year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association.",O
The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.,O
"We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.",O
"Present Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries.",O
"Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.",O
"Possible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.",O
These self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.,O

Number of convents: 6,O
Number of nuns: 73,O
Solemnly professed: 73,O
In formation: ....,O
"Average age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]",O
What has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.,O
This has created a close communion from the beginning.,O
Everyone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.,O
Present Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.,O
4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.,O
Another Carmel was renewed in 1990.,O
At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.,O
"With the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.",O
"Also, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.",O
"Finally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.",O
Due to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.,O
We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.,O
The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.,O
"Possible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.",O
We began from three points:,O
"1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.",O
"2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.",O
"The team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.",O
"3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.",O
This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.,O
"In October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.",O
They had meetings with Fr.,O
General and with the Congregation for Religious.,O
These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.,O
An important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.,O
"We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.",O
"It is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.",O
Definitive permission came at the 25th of February.,O

"Sr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.",O
Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:,O
The nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:,O
"“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future.",O
We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.,O
It is a wide road that opens up before us.,O
We must be women of hope and faith.,O
We must always believe that God is the one who directs history.,O
"From this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]",O
"Instead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”",O
"Given that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about.",O
Was Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?,O
It is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.,O
"His first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.",O
Certainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.,O
"On the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change.",O
Autonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.,O
General; other solutions to government.”,O
"The devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned.",O
And there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.,O
"A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:",O
“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?,O
“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?,O
“At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.,O
"Stability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?",O
"“The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.",O
Can such essential autonomy continue as it is?,O
“50 years ago there was stability.,O
How do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.,O
General?,O
“Could there be other forms of government?”,O
"Following the Father General’s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:",O
"“While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of ‘external’ interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.",O
"Though we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.” “...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when… the same person remains prioress for years.” “...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.",O
We perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.,O
"We do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.” “...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.”",O
"Maybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the “progressivist” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.",O
"What comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.",O
And with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.,O
But this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.,O

Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama,O
"A former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.",O
"Specifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.",O
"His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.",O
"“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.",O
Hillary is still walking free.,O
Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.,O
We want them to correct the wrong.”,O
Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.,O
There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.,O
"“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.",O
“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”,O
"While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.",O

"Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.",O
"He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.",O
"Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.",O
"But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails.",O
"“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said.",O
"Saucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.",O
A felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.,O
"Now, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.",O
"“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said.",O
"“I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”",O
"Because of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.",O

"American Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE!",O
| Articles,O
),O
December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.,O
"Simultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September.",O
"And, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.",O
"According to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18%.",O
"This follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.",O
"Not since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months—but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding.",O
Note that this is a net figure.,O
The year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.,O
"About 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies.",O
[U.S.,O
"Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.",O
This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).,O
"The additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status).",O
"The Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month—well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.",O
In December 2017:,O
"Immigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%",O
"Native-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27%",O
"The immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9.",O
The native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..,O
"The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9/106.0))",O
Trump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years.,O
"But by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters.",O
While overall wage growth remains modest – 2.5% per annum in December – Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin:,O
"…In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers.",O
"In some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%…” Blue-collar wages are surging.",O
"Can it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017",O
Eleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama.,O
Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election:,O
"Can't render, error",O
"Native-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI—the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth—is in blue.",O
"Another way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years.",O
"Immigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November’s 17.16% share.",O
"Can't render, error",O
A detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.,O
Over the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017):,O
The native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.,O
as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.,O
American employment grew 57% faster than immigrant employment: 1.27% versus 0.81%.,O
"The labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans.",O
"At 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.)",O
"The number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000—down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000—down by 11%.",O
"Another piece of good news, quite possibly connected to the shrinking of the immigrant working age population, caught our eye: The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to 6.8% in December , the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking the figure in 1972.",O
"[ U.S. economy added 2 million jobs in 2017 , by Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, January 5, 2018]",O

A rough patch—or a double-dip recession?,O
And Wall Street is plainly beginning to panic.,O
Unemployment is a case in point.,O
But unemployment is befuddling anyway.,O
"Just a few weeks ago professional prognosticators were expecting job growth of 175,000 in May.",O
"However, nonfarm payroll growth came in at 54,000 in May, the smallest gain since September, and a fraction of the just lowered consensus forecast (125,000 jobs.)",O
"The ""other"" employment survey, of households rather than businesses, also broadcast mixed signals—at least so far as the prospects for native-born workers are concerned.",O
"VDARE.com has long argued that the household survey captures the employment of illegal aliens; additionally, it actually mentions ethnicity.",O
"In May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000.",O
Non-Hispanics actually gained ground:,O
"Total employment: up 105,000 (+0.08 percent)",O
"Non-Hispanic employment: up 190,000 (+0.16 percent)",O
"Hispanic employment: down 85,000 (-0.42 percent)",O
"Thus VDAWDI—VDARE.com's American Worker Displacement Index, unveiled in 2004 and still unique—fell to 126.2 in May from April's 127.0 level.",O
"This, of course, is atypical statistical noise.",O
Non-Hispanics have lost jobs at twice the rate of Hispanics since the recession hit in December 2007.,O
"And since the official start of the ""recovery"" in June 2009, Hispanics have gained 416,000 jobs while non-Hispanics have lost 675,000 positions.",O
"Since January 2001 the number of non-Hispanics holding jobs has declined by 1.9 million, or by -1.6%.",O
"Over that same period Hispanic employment rose by 3.9 million, up a whopping 24.2%.",O
"This Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was, of course, a convenient proxy for VDARE.com's primary interest: foreign-born workers and their role in displacing their native-born counterparts.",O
We tracked this by looking at Hispanics because such a high proportion of them are foreign-born—and because the federal government declined to provide data on immigrant vs. non-immigrant unemployment.,O
"However, since January 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] has begun to publish figures for foreign-born and native-born employment.",O
"These data are not seasonally adjusted, making month to month trends difficult to interpret.",O
BLS resolves the dilemma by comparing the current month with the same month of the prior year:,O

The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal.,O
The Washington Times has more:,O
"A copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities.",O
She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.,O
"The Iranian government “uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said.",O

"He made the comment a day after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.",O
The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal’s success as it was still being negotiated.,O
"The Senate Homeland Security Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.",O
"“Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.",O
"“Despite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.",O
"“Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,” the report said.",O
Sen.,O
"Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel’s findings Wednesday.",O
"Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained “illegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.”",O
The ban included any “intermediary” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.,O
"On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.",O
"On Tehran’s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control.",O
According to the Senate report: “Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.,O
"[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.”",O
"Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.",O
"“On February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,” according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made “even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”",O
"Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama “administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.”",O
"The catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.",O
"Despite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.",O
"“Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,” Mr. Portman said.",O
"“The only reason this transaction wasn’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.”",O

"Ex-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then–IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees.",O
"The dispute came after Awan’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.",O
"The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan’s whole family to her daughter’s bat mitzvah and said she had “helped him with a land deal,” the sources said.",O
A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.,O
"Awan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said.",O
"“About a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings — all aged between 57 and 70 — have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,” Dawn reported.",O
"Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.",O
"The police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with “frivolous” cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.",O
"A third source, who’s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened.",O
A fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.,O
"Dr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that “Imran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.”",O
"On July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family.",O
"Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother’s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz’s Florida.",O
"The finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.",O
"In February 2017, Kiko and the House’s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network.",O
The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.,O
"But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.",O
"The congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.",O
"Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.",O
The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.,O
Fleet did not respond to a request for comment.,O
"“Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said.",O
"Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.",O
"House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.",O
"Yet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.”",O
"Despite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.",O
"Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney client privilege,” according to a police report.",O
"Awan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.",O
"That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop.",O
"When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.",O
"Wasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.",O
Wasserman Schultz’ district includes much of Miami.,O
"One of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.",O
Prosecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.,O
"In August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.",O
"Prosecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.",O
"Capitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said.",O
Wasserman Schultz’s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.,O
Wasserman Schultz did not respond to a request for comment.,O

"Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school.",Loaded_Language
"For example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘white privilege’.",Loaded_Language
"Brian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.",Repetition

"Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an international affairs assistant in the Iran’s judiciary, disclosed in Farsi-language remarks broadcast on Iran’s state-controlled television that Iranian intelligence officials secretly helped provide the al Qaeda attackers with passage and gave them refuge in the Islamic Republic, according to an English translation published by Al Arabiya.",O
"“Our government agreed not to stamp the passports of some of them because they were on transit flights for two hours, and they were resuming their flights without having their passports stamped.",O

In the media these were described as “clashes.” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.,O
"A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.",O
Where does he come into the picture?,O
JP:I think it comes down to information.,O
"If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.",O
The right to know what governments are doing in our name—on our behalf or to our detriment—is our moral right.,O
Julian feels very passionately about this.,O
There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.,O
I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.,O
This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.,O
It detailed how subversion should work.,O
I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.,O
It also reminds us that so-called “meddling” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.,O
The word “meddling” doesn’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.,O
It is intervention in another country’s affairs.,O
WikiLeaks has done that all over the world.,O
It has given people the information they have a right to have.,O
They had a right to find out from the so-called “War Logs” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.,O
"That’s when, on Clinton’s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.",O
You can see why Julian made enemies.,O

"In analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report’s conclusions, it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version, which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release, emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form.",Loaded_Language
"Starting with Comey’s public announcement on July 5, 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” but also announcing that the FBI was “expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general.",Loaded_Language
"However, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card.",Loaded_Language

"If putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough, Comey’s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months, including, most importantly, changing the description of Clinton’s handling of classified information from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.” This change was critical because “gross negligence” is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code § 793(f) for a finding of criminal conduct.",Repetition
"Comey’s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase, “extremely careless,” for the “gross negligence” statutory legal standard he had originally used, had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton’s favor.",Repetition
Inspector General Horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase “gross negligence” from Comey’s statement.,Repetition
Mr. Horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge Clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving e-mails determined to contain classified information.,Repetition

FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist,O
"Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama.",O
Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols.,O
"The report from the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.",O
Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts.,O
Mr. Horowitz’s report focused on process and procedures.,O
"The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that “his review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions.""",O
"To be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting “the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.” Comey, according to the OIG report, “engaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.”",O
"He “upset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,” the report said.",O
"Comey’s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized.",O
"The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton’s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.",O
"This letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey’s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate.",O
Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did.,O
"The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election.",O
"The criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation.",O
"Hillary Clinton’s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general’s criticisms of Comey’s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump’s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons.",O
"The fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo.",O
"Indeed, Comey admitted in his book that “we started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.”",O
"Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits.",O
"Mr. Horowitz’s report thus concluded, “We did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.” This conclusion defies common sense.",O
"Clinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information.",O
It turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties.,O
Hillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact.,O
"As Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton.",O
Yet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.,O
"Incredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz’s report “found no persuasive evidence… that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.”",O
Mr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey’s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral.,O
"Comey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was.",O
Mr. Horowitz simply took Comey’s word for what he had meant.,O
"Inspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a “troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication” between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey’s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress.",O
"As to the substance of Ms. Lynch’s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife’s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz’s report had to say was that it was “an error in judgment.”",O
"Trump is “not ever going to become president, right?",O
Right?,O
!” Page texted Strzok.,O
“No.,O
No he’s not.,O
"We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.",O
"Mr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was “not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.” The inspector general questioned whether Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.",O
Strzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C.,O
"§ 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States.",O
"The punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both.",O
"Instead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.",O
"Inspector General Michael Horowitz’ report on the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former FBI Director James Comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the Clinton investigation, it stops short of blaming it all on politics.",Loaded_Language
"Horowitz’ report not only slams Comey, but it also criticizes former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and immoral FBI philanderers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.",Loaded_Language
"Horowitz blames Comey, Strzok, and Page for besmirching the good name of the FBI and harming the agencies reputation with the American people.",Flag-Waving
"However, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI’s Obama era leadership.",Loaded_Language
"The Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a “willingness to take official action” to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president… Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing “willingness to take official action” to hurt Trump’s chances to become president.",Loaded_Language
"Perhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that “we’ll stop” Trump from making it to the White House.",Loaded_Language
"The inspector general concluded that Strzok’s text, along with others disparaging Trump, “is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.”",Loaded_Language
"But it wasn’t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump… DURING the investigation.",Loaded_Language
"The IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense.",Loaded_Language
The report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton’s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case.,Loaded_Language
"The inspector general derided the bureau’s reasons for not moving more quickly — that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn’t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case — as “unpersuasive,” “illogical,” and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton.",Loaded_Language
"“Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,” the report said.",Doubt
How in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?,Doubt
This is INSANE.,Loaded_Language
"Meanwhile, another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess.","Name_Calling,Labeling"
"The email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it’s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as “grossly negligent,” in the handling of classified intel.",Loaded_Language
"Remember, Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey’s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable “grossly negligent” to the legally superflous “extremely careless.”",Loaded_Language

"I believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case, and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled, it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably.",Loaded_Language

"At the end of the day, Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case.",O
"While the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI’s political leanings in his Russia report.",O

"“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?",O
Right?,O
"!” the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.",O
“No.,O
No he won’t.,O
"We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded…",O
"The messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the inspector general wrote…",O
"Strzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn’t win, and that he wasn’t implying that they would take action to stop his election.",O
Page and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.,O
"The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought “discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI’s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.” The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe.",O
"“The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,” Horowitz alleged.",O
"“Ultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.”",O
"By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned “virtually every fact” it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner’s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin.",O
"The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead.",O
Did you get that?,O
"IG Horowitz can’t prove it, but he’s not sure that Strzok wasn’t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.",O
"We see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?",O
"There were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!",O
"Not only that, the team that handled Clinton’s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!",O
"Meaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.",O
"Not only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.",O
"In a newly released FBI email, we learned that “foreign actors” gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email system.",O
"Fox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week’s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.",O
"The IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday.",O
"The House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton’s email security.",O
"“Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails — including at least one email classified ‘Secret,'” the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.",O
Here’s the email in question:,O
Peter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd,O
At HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:,O
"In the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton.",O
Strzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when “Petraeus/Berger/Libby” did not.,O
"He writes, “We draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e.",O
"notwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.” In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn’t intentionally give anything away.",O
"Of course, the statute itself didn’t make intent a prerequisite.",O
"Herridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: “Officials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite ‘intent’ for charges to be filed,” the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required — which the memo says ignored “meaningful aspects” of the law.",O
"It really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.",O
"However, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he’s concluded his Russia investigation.",O
"In fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report.",O
"Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok’s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.",O

"In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.",O
On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.,O
Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.,O
"The attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton.",O
Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads.,O
The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.,O
Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.,O
Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.,O
"“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.",O
"If the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.",O
Horowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”,O
"Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.",O
"As for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.",O
King said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.,O
"And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.",O
"Horowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”",O
"The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.",O
Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.,O
"Horowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”",O
"“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.",O
Jordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”,O
Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.,O
"“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.",O
"Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.",O
"“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.",O
“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.,O
"Horowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.",O
"By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.",O
Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.,O
Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.,O

President Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus’ missing server in a tweet.,O
An IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.,O
"“The Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,” it read.",O
"A House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus’s payroll.",O
The official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers.,O
"According to payroll records, Abid’s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus’ systems administrator.",O
"The Awans’ continued physical access to Becerra’s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence, House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF.",O
"(RELATED: Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server, But Logins Continued; He Didn’t Go To Cops)",O
"Becerra has refused to comment, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.",O
"“These employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them, without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member’s office,” it said, adding, “4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times.” More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office’s staff, it said.",O
"Chris Gowen — a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran’s attorney — told TheDCNF, “There is no missing server and never was.”",O
"The memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence, including, “Interview notes with House Members’ Chiefs of Staff,” and “Logon activity and computer access logs.” Prosecutors have not brought charges.",O
"The Awans were banned from Congress’s computer network the day the letter was sent, and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them.",O
But Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo.,O
"Rep. Jackie Speier — a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife, Hina Alvi — said she never heard of any missing server.",O
Joaquin Castro of Texas — another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans — told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue.,O
"Yet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges — even though the letter also says House authorities have “purchase orders and vouchers” that allegedly show procurement fraud, as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud.",O
"The FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud.",O
"Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud.",O
"Wendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported.",O
"Eighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo, prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained.",O
Imran is in court July 3 for a possible plea deal in the bank fraud case.,O

"Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue.",O
"The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint.",O
"Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.",O
"“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.",O
"“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.",O
"They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.",O
"That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.",O
"Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.",O

Why?,O
"Because now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.",O

And we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.,O

"This actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.",O

Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.,O
The first Scripture says:,O
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.,O
For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.,O
"God ordained the power, and that “rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.""",O
Did God tell His Church to submit to that which He condemns?,O
"Is the Church to transgress His Laws, or to magnify and enforce His Laws unto judgment?",O
"If He did, that would make God unjust.",O
"Jesus said, ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil” (Matthew 5:17).",O
"The Lord has, in fact, commanded nowhere in Scripture for the Church to submit to the wicked.",O
The Bible teaches just the exact opposite.,O
"Furthermore, it would contradict what Scripture teaches us from Genesis all the way to Revelation every step of the way.",O
"They are appointed to magnify law against crime, not crime against the law (Psalm 94:20).",O
"America is based on Common Law, the Mosaic Institution.",O
Read the 5 books of Moses.,O
Submit to what God condemns?,O
Did Christian martyrs violate God’s principles of submission to authority?,O
"Also, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters.",O
"God never gave them that authority and any, and all, government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection.",O
Civil government is a “minister for God to thee for good” (Romans 13:4).,O
It is not a minister of God for evil.,O
Common sense does come into play here.,O
"And when Pharaoh refused, God plagued the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and set His children free.",O
Is this what is being preached from the pulpits across America today?,O
Or what of Gideon who was to deliver the Children of Israel from the Midianites?,O
The first thing the Lord commanded him to do was to tear down his father's altars (Judges 6:25).,O
Was this a violation of God's principles of submission?,O
The sins of the fathers were the reason the Midianites had power to oppress them.,O
"What of that lone prophet, Elijah?",O
"Elijah took Ahab and the false prophets to the top of Mount Carmel where the God of Israel consumed the sacrifice by fire, and the false prophets were killed (1 Kings 18:38-40).",O
What of King David?,O
Was he violating God’s principles of submission when he refused to surrender himself to Saul’s troops?,O
David was a king that was to overthrow corrupt governments by dispossessing them and establishing righteousness through justice and judgment (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 51:4).,O
"Did Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego violate God's principle of submission when they refused to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s image?",O
"Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",O
"That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:",O
Daniel 3:3-6,O
"“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.” Daniel 3:28",O
Did Daniel violate God's principles of submission when he disobeyed the king's order to stop praying to any god but himself?,O
Keep in mind that the punishment was that Daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which God sent forth an angel to protect him.,O
His accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured Daniel (Daniel 6).,O
What of Jeremiah?,O
Was he violating God's principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings?,O
"For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.",O
Jeremiah 1:18,O
"Was that violating, or fulfilling God's principles and purposes?",O
What of the New Testament?,O
Was this a violation of submission to civil government?,O
"No, it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and His laws.",O
"Is it a violation of submission to God's principles to keep preaching, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”?",O
"“Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.",O
"And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.",O
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.,O
"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.",O
"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?",O
"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,",O
"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.",O
"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.",O
"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.",O
"And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.",O
"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,",O
"Saying, What shall we do to these men?",O
for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.,O
"But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.",O
"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.",O
"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.",O
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” Acts 4:2-20,O
“Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.,O
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.,O

(Then were the days of unleavened bread.),O
"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.",O
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.,O
"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.",O
"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.",O

Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”,O
"Well, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?",O
"McCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr.",O
The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.,O
It’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.,O
"We are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.",O
The McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.,O
Rod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.,O
"It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.",O
This is the result of a mass-collusion.,O
"As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.",O
"The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.",O
"Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”",O
"In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].",O
"When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.",O
This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.,O
"As Dreher reported,",O
"Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.",O
"If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.",O
"Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.",O
"When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.",O
Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.,O
"For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.",O
I’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.,O
How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?,O
Where are they to live?,O
How are they to maintain themselves?,O
"As men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.",O
"In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.",O
"The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.",O
"And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.",O
"Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.",O
"And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.",O
He will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.),O
"I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.",O
Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.,O
Of course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.,O
"Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.",O
But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.,O
"I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.",O
"As one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.",O
So what do we do?,O
The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.,O
"As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.",O
It’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.,O
We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.,O
"If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.",O
"The other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.",O
"In response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”",O
I responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.,O
"We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”",O
I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.,O
"This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.",O
"I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]",O
I responded that this was going about things the wrong way.,O
"Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.",O
"First of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.",O
"Let’s not give them that, OK?",O
There’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.,O
"Second, it’s simply not going to work.",O
They’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.,O
They know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.,O
The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.,O
There’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.,O
No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.,O
We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.,O
He should own a house or stand to inherit one.,O
Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.,O
"And more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.",O
Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.,O
But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.,O
How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?,O
Change the oil in a car?,O
Rewire a house?,O
The standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.,O
How many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?,O
"Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.",O
"Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.",O
That’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.,O
Don't miss Hilary White's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper; Subscribe today!,O
It reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.,O
One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.,O
"This college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.",O
"This is fine, good idea.",O
But I asked him what he knew how to do.,O
“Can you fix a bathroom pipe?,O
Do you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?,O
"Can you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.",O
There is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.,O
Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?,O
"Wouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?",O
"Or for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?",O
"If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.",O
I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.,O
"Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.",O
"Simply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.",O
This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.,O
"The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!",O
What’s your trade?,O
What do you have to fall back on?”,O
"I’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.",O
Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.,O
"Meanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.",O
That monastery in Germany is lost.,O
Those bishops want the property and they’ll get it.,O
"What the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.",O
Bishops won’t protect and support good priests?,O
"The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?",O
We’re not helpless.,O
We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.,O
"Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.",O
I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.,O
"They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.",O
Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.,O
"Two trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.",O
The museum’s website tells us:,O
"“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.",O
"With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.",O
"Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.",O
"Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.",O
No items were lost during the evacuation.”,O
"To keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.",O
"They understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.",O
"Does this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?",O
Not necessarily.,O
But we’d be fools to wait for them.,O
"Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.",O
"And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.",O
The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.,O

"Trump could also try to replace Sessions as attorney general with someone who does not have a conflict of interest from the campaign, allowing that person to relieve Rosenstein of the responsibility to oversee Mueller, Vladeck said.",O

Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium .,O
.,O
A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.,O
"Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law.",O
"In those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty .",O
.,O
"In the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being.",O
"If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.",O
"Today the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder.",O
"John Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever.",O
But doesn’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?,O
"If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “tradition which comes from the Apostles” actually “develops in the Church” and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).",O
The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.,O

In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.,O
"At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century.",O
Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.,O
"In modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives.",O
It is only to be expected that materialists—for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has—should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.,O
"In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose.",O
"Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit.",O
Nor was the idea of “rehabilitation” with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.,O

"The Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.” Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate.",O

Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal,O
"Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):",O
"Every time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.",O
"I’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.",O
"While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again.",O
"The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.",O
It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.,O
"A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.",O
"I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.",O
What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.,O
"When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).",O
"By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.",O
It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.,O
"Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.",O
"While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.",O
"Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.",O
"I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.",O
"With St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.",O
"When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.",O
I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.,O
"While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there’s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese.",O

"I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.",O
"Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.",O
"Far from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an ""inclusive community"" that ""welcomes all"" and ""judges none.""",O
"All very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.",O

Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""",O
They are contrary to the natural law.,O
They close the sexual act to the gift of life.,O
They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.,O
Under no circumstances can they be approved.,O
"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)",O
Under no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.,O
"Even Pope John Paul ""The GREAT's"" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:",O
"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.",O
"Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.",O
It is not.,O
"Notice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.",O
Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?,O
Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?,O
"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our ""Catholic Christian"" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?",O
Pope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.,O
"“It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”",O
Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?,O
"Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?",O
"We're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.",O
"Quite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.",O
This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!,O
"But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of ""accompaniment"" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.",O
So what's going on here?,O
"Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?",O
"Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the ""gay lifestyle"" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?",O
"The Catholic Church's new-found ""climate of tolerance"" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!",O
Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.,O
"And neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.",O
Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.,O
"Bishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a “hater” for defending the Church’s teaching on marriage—an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.","Name_Calling,Labeling"

"In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes.",O
"They will be crucified in the media, yes.",O
Nothing less will do.,O
MJM,O
Bishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church,O
"August 18, 2018",O
"Dear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,",O
"The past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals.",O
Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.,O
"Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick.",O
But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.,O
"For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities.",O
"To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.",O
"If you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal.",O
"Also, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.",O
There is nothing about these stories that is okay.,O
"Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.",O
And why?,O
The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.,O
"We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.",O
So what is new?,O
"What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.",O
"Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”",O
For too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.,O
"In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.",O
In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.,O
Why do we do this?,O
Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?,O
Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?,O
Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?,O
"Perhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.",O
"In the end, the excuses do not matter.",O
We must be done with sin.,O
It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.,O
Love sinners?,O
Yes.,O
Accept true repentance?,O
Yes.,O
But do not say sin is okay.,O
"And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.",O
"For the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.",O
The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.,O
"There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.",O
"If you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!",O
"As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.",O
"As the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.",O
8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.,O
"There must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.",O
"To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.",O
In this I speak of all sin.,O
"We’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.",O
"We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.",O
To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.,O
There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.,O
"That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.",O
It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.,O
"To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.",O
"In this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.",O
"While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.",O
It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.,O
"The Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.",O
Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.,O
"But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.",O
"At the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.",O
"In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.",O
"Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.",O
"The sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.",O
The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.,O
"It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.",O
"And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.",O
I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.,O
"However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.",O
"No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.",O
"I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.",O
"Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:",O
"In the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.",O
"This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.",O
"We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.",O
"Here again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.",O
If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.,O
"If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.",O
"To our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.",O
"To our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.",O
"You are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.",O
This is to keep you very close to God.,O
"In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.",O
"In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.",O
"And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.",O
God will give you the graces to do so.,O
Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.,O
"And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.",O
"To the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.",O
It will be addressed quickly and justly.,O
"If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.",O
"Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.",O
"Furthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;",O
"I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;",O
I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.,O
Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;,O
"I will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;",O
"I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.",O
"I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;",O
I ask everyone reading this to pray.,O
"We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and",O
"Finally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.",O
"I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.",O
"In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.",O
"Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.",O
"This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.",O
"More than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.",O
We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.,O
We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.,O
We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.,O
"Again, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.",O
I stand with them.,O
I don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.,O
"But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”",O
"Faithfully yours in the Lord,",O

"Genesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah.",O
Lot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.,O
The angels agreed.,O
"The Bible then informs us, ""Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom — both young and old — surrounded the house.",O
"They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?",O
Genesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.,O
"Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities..."" (Genesis 19:2 4) .",O
"In light of the passage, the most common response to the question, ""What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?""",O
is that it was homosexuality.,O
"That is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.",O
"Clearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.",O
"At the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.",O
The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.,O
"So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.",O
Those who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.,O
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.,O
But to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.,O
"To this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland.",O
(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.,O
"Men today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth.",O
They are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).,O
"They care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).",O
Men today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through “antinomianism” than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).,O
"Instead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.",O
They wear the cross.,O
"Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: “Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).",O
"Then again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out ""Crucify him!",O
Crucify him!,O
"We have no king but Caesar"" (John 19:15).",O
And these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).,O

"Today, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times.",O

Where did those fifth columnists enter?,O
Aggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur.,O
The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to “bring itself up to date” is ridiculous.,O
Yet that was precisely the aim.,O
"As St Pope John XXIII explained, “Its principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.” It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570.",O
"The goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution.",O
"Now, I don’t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition.",O
I share Pope Paul IV’s view.,O
"Nonetheless, he stirred it.",O
The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s – and the seminaries especially.,O
Seminarians called for a more “participatory” administration.,O
They became involved in socialist politics.,O
They formed trade unions to demand the right to marry.,O

"“One also felt that, in these events of May,” Marty continued, “the seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.” Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries.",O
"As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly “out of step” and in need of “modernizing”.",O
"Inevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality.",O
"Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of “an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.”",O
But that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.,O
"Rather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men – given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries.",O
"This began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church’s teachings on chastity and celibacy.",O
But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “seduce” his victims.,O
"Many have also speculated that, because McCarrick’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn’t consider them newsworthy.",O

That’s not very aggiornamentistic!,O
"The world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind.",O

We seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass.,O

"Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover-up, Calls on Francis to Resign",O
"I am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs.",O
"The Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life.",O
May God save His Church MJM,O
"So serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign.",O
"But before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water.",O
He and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.,O
"Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's ""kingmaker"" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals.",O
The former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse.,O
“Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops” (Lk.,O
12:3).,O
"I had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself.",O
"That is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia.",O
"But now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016.",O
"As Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.)",O
"and the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State.",O
"Indeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.’s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo.",O
"In the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the ’80s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop “shared his bed with seminarians,” inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house.",O
"And he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.",O
"The office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State.",O
"The Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public.",O
He therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.,O
"In my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:",O
"- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,",O
"- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can.",O
"1405 § 1, No.",O
"2˚, “ipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi”;",O
"- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church.",O
"I added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press.",O
This could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors.,O
"My memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter.",O
"Subsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com.",O
"On April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone.",O
"It was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008.",O
"The following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006.",O
"In it, I summarized Richard Sipe’s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: “I approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time.",O
The problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome.,O
"If Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.”",O
"I ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal’s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state.",O
"Pope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.",O
"I certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies.",O
"I believe it was due to the Pope’s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope.",O
"In any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi.",O
"Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Chargé d'Affaires a.i.",O
"after the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington — and he is ready to testify to it— about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature.",O
Monsignor Lantheaume told me that “the Nuncio’s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.”,O
"Pope Benedict’s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio.",O
"In turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.",O
"The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.",O
"It is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia.",O
Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him.,O
"In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.",O
It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.,O
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.",O
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.",O
"Benedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.",O
"Was McCarrick’s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill?",O
We are not given to know.,O
"However, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this.",O
"McCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia.",O
"If Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn’t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions.",O
"His nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.",O
"At the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington.",O
"Nuncio Sambi’s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.",O
"My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.",O
"As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict.",O
"Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents.",O
"In April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick’s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less.",O
"As Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid.",O
Ça va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!,O
"The same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation.",O
They were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.,O
"Cardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.",O
Nor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know.,O
"As Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State.",O
"As far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons.",O
"Cardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology.",O
Others belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.,O
Now to the United States.,O
"Obviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick’s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.",O
"It is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it.",O
"In any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.",O
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.",O
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.",O
"If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?",O
Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.,O
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.",O
"Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.",O
The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.,O
"However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.",O
I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.,O
But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!,O
"Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.",O
"In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.",O
"Bishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims.",O
They cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.,O
"Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick.",O
"Given his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him.",O
I don’t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel’s crimes.,O
"If he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?",O
* * *,O
"In the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions.",O
"The date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013.",O
Pope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor.,O
Of course I also came to Rome from Washington.,O
"It was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.",O
"On the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there.",O
"As soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock.",O
I greeted him respectfully as I had always done.,O
"He immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.”",O
"At the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.",O
"Nor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave.",O
"Therefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.",O
The next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.,O
"After his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one.",O
"In single file, I remember that I was among the last.",O
"When it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, “I am the Nuncio to the United States.” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: “The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!",O
"I had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me “so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.” I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.",O
At the end of the audience the Pope announced: “Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.,O
"On Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week.",O
How could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?,O
"At the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: “The Pope told me to ask if you are free now!” Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately.",O
The Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: “We have 40 minutes before the Angelus.”,O
"I began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday.",O
"And the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: “Yes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing — and he added, raising both arms — and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.” Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.",O
"Immediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.",O
"But then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.",O
"Back in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis.",O
"When the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics.",O
"When he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: “the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds….” I was astounded!",O
"It was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick.",O
"Also the Pope’s mention “not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia” could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians.",O
"In his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion.",O
"Indeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.",O
"Not happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his protégés, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.",O
Once again the Pope did not show any reaction.,O
"It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews.",O
"In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.",O
"This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.",O
With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops.,O
"In addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari — the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio — as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary.",O
Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.,O
"During the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water.",O
"Perhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine.",O
"Extolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism.",O
"In support of this thesis, Cupich “oddly” made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he “candidly” ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male.",O
"In fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.”",O
"The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: “Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.",O
"These characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs.",O
"We need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O’Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O’Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States.",O
"It should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits.",O
"Father James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus.",O
Pope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia.,O
The faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner.,O
"He must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests.",O
"In any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him.",O
He did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.,O
"The latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope’s protection that he can dismiss as “gossip” the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary.",O
"In the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan José Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L’Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: “It was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to ‘clear’ his name after being subjected to much slander.” Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.",O
"In the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public.",O
"Finally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga.",O
From 2003 to 2007 Peña Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature.,O
As Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.,O
"In Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated.",O
"The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.",O
First he insulted the abuse victims.,O
"Even in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis’s behavior was no different.",O
"Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.",O
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media.",O
"Now in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick’s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign.",O
A time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed.,O
The virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries.,O
Corruption in the misuse of the Church’s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against.,O
The seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced.,O
"The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote.",O
"“The problem of clergy abuse,” she wrote, “cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.",O
"The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.",O
"I implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.",O
"In his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father’s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ’s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God’s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men.",O
"At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...",O
"If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.",O
"We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.",O
And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!,O
Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.,O
"Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.",O
"In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.",O
"Even in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope!",O

"Recently a Muslim spokesman in Tunisia named Said Khecharem, who is affiliated with the international pro-Sharia, pro-caliphate organization Hizb ut-Tahrir, declared (to delighted screams of “Allahu akbar” from his audience), that the “establishment of an Islamic state…requires the conquest of America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy – Rome and other infidel lands will be conquered, Allah willing.”",Loaded_Language
"According to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Khecharem also said: “After the laws of Allah were abandoned, and the heretic regimes were imposed on the Muslims, the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the Muslims, through the Quran and the Sunna, in order to renew Islamic life and to deliver the Islamic message to the world.",Flag-Waving

"If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy “the filthy Jewish entity” and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of “Islamophobia” and “bigotry.” But no one will take any particular notice of this.",O
"They should, however.",O
Khecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a Tunisian street corner.,O
"He was speaking at Hizb ut-Tahrir’s International Caliphate Conference; although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago.",O

"As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the “Rightly Guided Caliphs” to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.",O
"This was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time.",O

"And so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.",O
What is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.,O
"As the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them.",O
"While it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.",O
So it is today.,O

"This article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli’s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as “neo-traditionalism.” As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN’s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016).",Loaded_Language
Faggioli’s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.,Loaded_Language
"All of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally—only weeks ago—took decisive action against his “trusted counselor.” McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio’s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported “same-sex marriage,” and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990.","Name_Calling,Labeling"

"In sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: “This neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy… and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.”","Name_Calling,Labeling"
"Rather than “young clergy marked by personal sanctity,” the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the “dialogue with modern culture.” It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty.","Name_Calling,Labeling"

"In his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio’s “Council of Cardinals”, covered up McCarrick’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.",O

"Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “trusted counselor” who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.",O
"Viganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.",O
"As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:",O
[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.,O

"Before he was papal nuncio in Washington, Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.",O
In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.,O
The campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.,O
"John Allen’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò’s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.",O

"Furthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò’s character and credibility:",O

"Bergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò’s testimony.",O
"During the return flight from Dublin after the “World Meeting of Familes,” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.",O
Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself:,O
Read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.,O
I am not going to say a word about this.,O
"I believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.",O
It is an act of trust.,O
"When a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.",O
"It will do you all good, really.",O
Seems to be.,O
Obviously.,O
"While events have overtaken Faggioli’s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.",O
"But before I address Faggioli’s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Viganò’s testimony.",O
This would explain why he will not a “say a word about” Viganò’s charges against him.,O
"The Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:",O
I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.,O
Viganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.,O
During the audience Bergoglio queried: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:,O
"I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.",O
"It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews….",O
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.",O
[all emphasis in original],O
"It was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.",O
"Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.” That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.",O
"As I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:",O
Cupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.,O
"And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal’s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.",O
But Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.,O
"A Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top",O
None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.,O
"Moreover, it was Bergoglio’s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan José Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.",O
"This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.",O
"The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.",O
"First, he insulted the abuse victims.",O
"Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.",O
[emphasis added],O
Defending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo,O
I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.,O
"Today, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.",O
"Wuerl, says Faggioli, “faces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry… while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases… It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol… beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.”",O
….,O
"I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.",O
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.",O
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.",O
Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.,O
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.",O
"Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.",O
The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.,O
I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.,O
But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!,O
"Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.",O
[emphasis in original],O
"What really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “complex situation,” which is not complex at all.",O
But what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?,O
"But one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.",O
Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.,O
"Instead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.",O
[emphasis added],O
Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “Catholic Jacobins” for “hate speech” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.,O
A return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.,O
"For some, it seems, no price is too great—not even the good of the Church—to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.",O
Conclusion: The Fatima Connection,O
"Long before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.",O
"As to Bertone and Sodano, Viganò provides further vital testimony:",O
"Nuncio Sambi’s report [on McCarrick’s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.",O
"My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.",O
Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.,O
"In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.",O
It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.,O
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.",O
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.",O
"Concerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Viganò’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict’s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:",O
"We were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.",O
"Sambi said, “Excuse me.” He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.",O
"“Here,” he said.",O
“Do you know this book?,O
You should read it.” It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.,O
"“Wait,” I said.",O
"And in the end, we are all after the truth, aren’t we?",O
The truth is the important thing...”,O
The truth is indeed the important thing.,O
"And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:",O
[emphasis added],O
I can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Viganò:,O

"First censorship, now this.",O
From Breitbart:,O
"An email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.",O
"The main email, headlined, “Election results and the Latino vote,” was sent on Nov. 9, 2016—the day after Clinton’s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election—by Eliana Murillo, Google’s Multicultural Marketing department head.",O
Murillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:,O
We worked very hard.,O
Many people did.,O
"We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices.",O
"We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work.",O
A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.,O
"We saw high traffic for the search queries ‘votar,’ ‘como votar,’ and ‘donde voter,’ in key states like Florida and Nevada.",O
We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.,O
Without translating our tools the users wouldn’t have found the information they needed.,O
"Objectively speaking, our goal was met — we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work.",O
"I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it.",O
"Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.",O
"“Sundar” presumably refers to Google’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015.",O
"“Lisa” presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google—who forwarded Murillo’s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo’s activities with official company resources as having made a “great difference.” “Philipp” presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google’s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.",O
The emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.,O
"Breitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.",O
"Carlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller—raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.",O
Epstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.,O
"In his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained.",O
Carlson said:,O
It wasn’t aimed at all potential voters.,O
It wasn’t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.,O
Google didn’t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles—they sometimes vote Republican.,O
"Furthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign.",O
"This was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting.",O
It was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.”,O
"Carlson noted that in communication with Google, the company “did not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.”",O
The email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:,O
"We had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more.",O
This reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.,O
"If Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story.",O
Murillo wrote in the next paragraph:,O
We even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).,O
We supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.,O
"They were a strong partner, among many in this effort.",O
The next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.,O
"“Ultimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,” Murillo wrote.",O
“We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.,O
"On the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: “2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?”",O
"Trump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states.",O
…,O
"“We read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!”",O
Then she begins writing again: “But then reality set in.,O
"Only 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn’t enough.”",O
"From there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:",O
"The voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida.",O
"Latino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college.",O
We’ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.,O
We know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.,O
Thanks again for all your help and support in this effort.,O
"“I have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,” Murillo wrote.",O
"After all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all.",O
"We are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don’t know what the future holds for them.”",O
Murillo wrote:,O
What’s most difficult for us is we can’t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.,O
"One in a remote office said ‘If you guys do any sort of meetings, I’d love to join virtually.",O
I think I’m currently the only Latinx in my office.,O
It’s kinda hard.’ #understatement.,O
She was not done there.,O
She also says that the company—and herself in particular—will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.,O
"“Loss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative.",O
My partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing — time to keep working harder.”,O
"“If you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,” Murillo wrote.",O
"It’s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever.",O
"At least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.”",O
"Then, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to “celebrate” a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation “will be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.”",O
"Murillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.",O
"“I’m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,” she wrote.",O
"Her original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.",O
“It’s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.”,O

That’s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation.,O

"I did not do this back in high school or at any time.""",O
"Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh’s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford.",O
"Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge.",O
"Instead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman’s wish to keep the matter confidential.",O
Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI.,O
The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation.,O
"Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because “the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion” and she had already “taken care of it,” according to a source quoted by The New Yorker.",O
"The New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation.",O
"However, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her “civic responsibility” and tell her own story publicly.",O

"When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.",O
"‘I thought he might inadvertently kill me,’ said Ford.",O
"‘He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.’” Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after “Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.”",O
Here is where Ms. Ford’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart.,O
"Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she “said she does not remember some key details of the incident,” according to the Washington Post article.",O
"For example, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.” She also does not remember how she got home.",O
"Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident.",O
"Ms. Ford admitted that she “told no one at the time what had happened to her.” In fact, she said she recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this.",O
"This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she “told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” according to the Washington Post article.",O
"In other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school – a therapist’s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident – did not mention Judge Kavanaugh’s name.",O
"Judge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced.",O

"“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.",O

"Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.",O
"At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.",O
"Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.",O
"We don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.",O
"I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.",O
Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true?,O
"Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.",O
I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.,O
I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.,O
But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.,O
Here’s why:,O
"First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.",O
Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?,O
"With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.",O
"Here, there was not.",O
"According to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”",O
That’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.,O
But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.,O
They actually contradict her story on a key detail.,O
"According to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.",O
"Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.",O
At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.,O
"If there were only four boys there, who were the other two?",O
Let’s hear from them.,O
"In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.",O
"Yet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?",O
Would they remember any details at all?,O
"If another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.",O
"But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….",O

But why is Fisher still “working hard not to assume the worst” when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years?,O
But it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power.,O
"At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò’s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation.",O
"Now even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Viganò’s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go:",O
"Of what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Viganò, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians?",O
Does the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning?,O
"Believing, as he does, that his claims are correct, Viganò, in calling for Francis’ resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law “to manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful…” 1983 CIC 212 § 3.",O
"I have not called for Francis’ resignation because I do not know (with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks) whether Viganò’s key allegations against Francis are substantially true; most assuredly, however, if I reach the conclusion that they are true, I would say, without hesitation, that Francis should resign.",O
"Yes, deposition.",O
The Synod declared that Benedict IX (who had refused to appear) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation.,O
"At Henry III’s designation, the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II, but he died after only a year, whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047, only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048.",O
"Damasus II, another German bishop designated by Henry, reigned for a mere three weeks before dying, whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy, reigning until 1054.",O
"Leo, as John Rao observes, was the first in a line of Popes who “took charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration” which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections.",O
"(Rao, Black Legends, 147-148).",O
"The King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope, who promptly crowned the King, Holy Roman Emperor.",O
"Benedict IX, after the death of Clement, claimed the papacy again!",O
The Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope.”,O
"Moreover, Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope—a valid but deposed Pope—during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes.",O
This was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations.,O
"Indeed, even the Vatican’s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force.",O
"Only with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee.",O
"By 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College “have held it ever since.” (Eric John, The Popes, 181).",O
"As Pope Benedict has observed, when it comes to the election of a Pope “the Spirit’s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that he [sic] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote….",O
So what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio?,O
"That the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church, but it certainly does not.",O
As to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity.,O
What would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates?,O
I am not saying that such a case has been proven.,O
"Rather, what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly, and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX.",O
"If a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046, why not an imperfect council today—or, for that matter, another synod?",O
It will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church.,O
"But that would not be the first time that defense of the Church’s common good has done so, as the Great Western Schism demonstrates.",O
"In any case, this much is certain: barring Bergoglio’s conversion and reversal of course, the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer.",O

Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations,O
"On Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party.",O
"The New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators.",O
"The article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh’s, concerning “a dormitory party gone awry.” As the article acknowledged, however, “her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.” The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was “reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty.” It was only after “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being “foggy” at the time.",O
The New Yorker article also noted that the magazine “has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.”,O
"Meanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had ""targeted"" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate ""gang rape.""",O
"While Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.",O
Her attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain “unresolved” issues.,O
"Among the issues Ms. Ford’s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as “who on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.""",O
A week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time.,O
They raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was “bullying” Ms. Ford.,O
He extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all.,O
"He had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable.",O
"However, in Senator Grassley’s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that “the committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them.",O
These are nonnegotiable.”,O
Some Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday’s scheduled hearing.,O
Then they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision.,O
All of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges – whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.,O
Proof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost.,O
"Regarding Ms. Ford’s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford’s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview.",O
"While a redacted version of Ms. Ford’s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version.",O
"The FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify.",O
Ms. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.,O
The individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged.,O
"Moreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember some key details of the incident.” She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident.",O
"She believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party.",O
"Moreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist’s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview.",O
Ms. Ramirez’s story is even less credible.,O
It took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.,O
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome.,O
The same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez.,O
"They argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply.",O
"Judge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting.",O
Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial.,O
"However, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether.",O
Judge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified.,O
His family’s lives have been completely upended.,O
Ms. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.,O
No more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify.,O
"If Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.",O
"If Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule.",O
Delay is not an option.,O

The biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.,O
Its divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.,O
Hence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.,O
"But if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers.",O

"On multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state’s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens.",O
"As Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.",O
Kavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn’t constitute a “search” as defined by the Fourth Amendment.,O
"To Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “constitutional.” In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone’s physical property, or track someone’s cell phone.",O
"Luckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.",O
"In June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.",O
But it gets worse.,O
"In 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA’s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is “entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.” To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure.",O
"According to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”",O
"“The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.",O
"Kavanaugh “has no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a “counterterrorism exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.",O
Representative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.,O
"However, this hasn’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.",O
"“There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.",O
"Indeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us.",O
The cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.,O

Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?,O
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s outstanding performance at yesterday’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America.,O
The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.,O
President Trump was delighted.,O
"“Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up.",O
"“His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting.",O
"Ford, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday.",O
Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford’s testimony concluded.,O
The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment.,O
But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.,O
Those efforts didn't work.,O
"When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed.",O
Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.,O
"This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff.",O
It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits.,O
"When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes.",O
Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.,O
"She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.",O
"Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.",O
It’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.,O
She could do little else.,O
She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.,O
As commentator Sean Davis tweeted:,O
"Nonetheless, Mitchell’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.",O
"In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.",O
Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh’s side remains to be seen.,O
"“No, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,” Ford replied.",O
"When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”",O
"She doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.",O
"At the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge’s nomination on July 9.",O
"As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.",O
"Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee’s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.",O
"The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.",O
"Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.",O
"Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.",O
The committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.,O
"Feinstein didn’t attend it, Grassley said.",O
"Kavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.",O
"That is “more than all prior Supreme Court nominees,” he said.",O
"“Throughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.",O
"Then, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.",O
"And then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”",O
"“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said.",O
"After Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said.",O
Kavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.,O
He denied the allegations categorically.”,O
"“Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.",O
"Grassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.",O
"“All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.",O
"Dr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. – Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.”",O
"Grassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, “even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress.”",O
"“Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination” by any means possible, “pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.”",O
"“We've been trying to investigate other allegations,” Grassley said.",O
"“At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.”",O
"Attorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.",O
“Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview.,O
"Lashing out at Democrats, Graham said, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.",O
"“God, I hope you never get it.",O
Graham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.,O
You want this seat?,O
"“It certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,” Hatch added.",O
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination today at 9:30 a.m.,O
"Asked last night about the nomination moving to the floor of the Senate for a final vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reportedly answered, ""Depends on what happens tomorrow.""",O

Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case,O
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved.,O
"Speaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent.”",O
"The dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.",O
Neither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case.,O
"But unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved.",O
"Pompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday.",O
Turkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday.,O
Erdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days.,O
"He said Saudi leaders made a commitment “to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.” He said they made “no exceptions,” including presumably members of the royal family.",O
"Asked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts.",O
"They didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.”",O
"Asked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment.",O
"“I think that’s — I think that’s — I think that’s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,” Pompeo said, “(and then) we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.”",O
"Pompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the “importance of the investigation.”",O
"Later Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “after a couple of delays.”",O
"Turkish officials “seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete” the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him.",O
"In a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world’s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran.",O
"“We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.",O
"Critics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration.",O
Saudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case.,O
"On Monday, they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “rogue killers,” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry.",O
Analysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out.,O

"The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.",O
It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.,O

"While most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian’s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism.",Loaded_Language

"November 29, 2018",O
In 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief.,O
Under her lead the paper took a new direction.,O
"On November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions.",O
Some two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments.,O
Assange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers.,O
On of those followers is Katherine Viner:,O
It attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send.,O
90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life.,O
It led the front page and also appeared in print.,O
The first version read:,O
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the Guardian has been told.",O
"Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House.",O
It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.,O
"But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",O
A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016.,O
Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.,O
His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.,O
The piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.,O
The Guardian piece came at a critical moment.,O
Currently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities.,O
"On Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal.",O
They distributed is as a factual account.,O
It is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.,O
Glenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance.,O
"There are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it.",O
Every visit is logged.,O
"If Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:",O
A year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:,O
Shortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:,O
"“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” the statement said.",O
"“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly.",O
We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”,O
At 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.,O
Caveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.,O
No editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:,O
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...",O
It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.,O
"But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",O
...,O
Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.,O
...,O
His lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.,O
One paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:,O
In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.,O
"At 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:",O
This story relied on a number of sources.,O
We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.,O
Neither responded to deny the visits taking place.,O
We have since updated the story to reflect their denials.,O
At 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.,O
Half an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.,O
Wikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.,O
As Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):,O
"Jonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:",O
Within hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.,O
...,O
Harding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia’s intelligence operation against the West’s democratic institutions.,O
...,O
"If this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false—that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.",O
It also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.,O
That claim was later removed.,O
We have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.,O
"When 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.",O

This is a Moon of Alabama fundraiser week.,O
No one pays me to write these blog posts.,O
