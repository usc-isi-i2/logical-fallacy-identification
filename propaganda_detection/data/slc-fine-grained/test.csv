Rombot’s lawyers said he was arrested despite a 2015 letter from ICE saying he would have a chance to prepare for an “orderly” departure.,O

It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.,O

"After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.",O
The Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.,O
That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.,O
"In 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.",O
"The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.",O

"President Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.",O
"The JCPOA’s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran’s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.",O
Obama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.,O
Instead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.,O

"Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.",O
Congress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.,O

"The Obama administration’s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.",O
The new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.,O
"The commander of Iran’s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was ""neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.",O
This is not a breach of the JCPOA.”,O

"“A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,” the Russian ambassador said.",O
"In short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.",O
"Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal’s terms then still being negotiated, “you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.""",O

THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE,O
Originally published the Jerusalem Post.,O
"On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.",O
"No, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.",O
Trump’s move was not operational.,O
It was directional.,O
"In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.",O
Trump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.,O
It is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.,O
"This was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.",O
"After accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.",O
"By empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.",O
"Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.",O
"Trump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.",O
"Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.",O
Trump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.,O
"He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.",O
"Obama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.",O
Today Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.,O
"If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.",O
And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.,O
"Leading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.",O
"Indeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.",O
"Then again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.",O
"And the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.",O
"The second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.",O
The problem here is not obvious.,O
"Clearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.",O
"Yet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.",O
"So long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.",O
To understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.,O
By taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.,O
"If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.",O
"A wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.",O
It would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.,O
It would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.,O
"Friday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.",O
"It is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.",O
"Last July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, warned that “putting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that ""if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.""",Appeal_to_fear-prejudice

Iranian Aggression Intensifies,O
"The next day the Iranian regime warned of a ""crushing"" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.",O
President Trump has called the Iranian regime’s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.,O
Designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.,O
"If Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.",O
"The U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime’s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.",O
"The Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.",O
"With the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.",O
"On Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.",O
Bagheri is quoted as saying that his visit’s purpose was to “put a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.” Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri’s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.,O
"Meanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC’s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.",O
"According to Debkafile, this constitutes “the first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.” The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi’s oil.",O
It is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.,O
"The session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.",O
She went after Iran instead.,O
"She explained why the Trump administration decided to take “a comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,” which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.",O
"“We can’t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,” Ambassador Haley said.",O
"The United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran’s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.",O
It’s critical that the international community do the same.,O
Judging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.,O
Ambassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to “play” the Security Council.,O
“Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.,O
And we have allowed them to get away with it.,O
This must stop.”,O
"Ambassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.",O
"“If it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn’t that same mentality apply to Iran?",O
“,O
"As for the Iran’s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN’s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran’s military sites.",O
Past work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.,O
"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA’s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency’s “tools are limited.” The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran’s nuclear activities.",O
"U.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea’s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.",O
The Obama administration chose to look the other way.,O
"Iran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.",O
It wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.,O
"In addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.",O
Proponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration’s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.,O
"""If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,"" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.",O
Germany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.,O
Other European allies have voiced similar concerns.,O
So have Obama’s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.,O
This argument is absurd on its face.,O
North Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.,O

Iran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.,O
Trump berated the country both before and after taking office.,O
"Fortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.",O
"On December 12, Trump’s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell’s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.",O

“The evidence is undeniable.,O
Buy Gold at Discounted Prices,O
"However, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.",O
As Common Dream’s Reza Marashi explained:,O
“Haley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.,O
"Of course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.",O
"Instead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have ‘no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.’ Asked about Haley’s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden’s ambassador to the UN said, ‘The info I have is less clear.’ Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley’s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles’ origin.",O
Perhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.,O
The world may never know.”,O
Ritter writes:,O
"“The missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.",O
"The modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.",O
"The UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]",O
"So where did the missiles come from, and who made them?",O
According to Ritter:,O
"“Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.",O
"The transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.",O
"This is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)",O
The difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.,O
"The increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.",O
"The Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.”",O
﻿,O
Those who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.,O
"In January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:",O
"“The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]",O
The issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.,O
"According to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.",O
Ritter explains further:,O
"“If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?",O
The fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.,O
"If the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.",O

Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:,O
"...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns.",O
"In fact, the agreement states that it ""does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.""",O
The lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.,O
Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.,O
That system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.,O

(Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.),O
"While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files—which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do—the distribution is already happening.",O

Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress.,O

The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis’s house.,O
Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.,O

"[W]e’re going to get rid of them,” Willis said.",O
"That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.” Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.",O
"In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.",O
The Haaf case wasn’t an aberration for Ellison.,O
"In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served—the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.",O

"“I hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.” Ellison’s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.",O

"Of course, the best coverage of this is from…Russia.",O
Sputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.,O
"You may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.",O

This signifies a re-consolidation of the media.,O
"Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.",O
"This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.",O
Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.,O
"So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news.",O
"People think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don’t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.",O
"For example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim’s side of the story.",O
"We give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.",O

"Jones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.",O

Google is in on it too.,O
A leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.,O
"Another Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart.",O
"The news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled “The Good Censor,” advises tech companies to “police tone instead of content” and to not “take sides” when censoring users… Google might continue to shift with the times – changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).",O
"If it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.",O

"In it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.",O

This affects everyone.,O
"If you’re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don’t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you’re missing the bigger point.",O
"Consider the fact that the “population” of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.",O

What can you do about the alternative media purge?,O

The purge happened around 12:30 p.m. CST with mainstream news reports launching at the same time — implying that they were given the heads up about the move.,O
"In a statement co-authored by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher — who Caitlin Johnstone aptly points out, also happens to be the former White House National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Policy — the massive social media platform explained that it has removed “559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”",O
"Facebook said the pages were “working to mislead others about who they are, and what they are doing.” However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.",O
"Our names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles.",O
"“We were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet.",O

"“Given the activity we’ve seen — and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections — we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,” Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked “people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.”",O
It should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web — this is the very definition of grassroots.,O

Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta’s press credential,O
CNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.,O
U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta’s White House press credential.,O
Kelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.,O
He did not rule on CNN’s claim that the revocation of the journalist’s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.,O
But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.,O
"The ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access.",O
CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House’s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.,O
"“We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,” a CNN representative said in a statement.",O
The White House said it would abide by Kelly’s ruling.,O
"“Today, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House.",O
"In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.",O
“We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.,O
There must be decorum in the White House.”,O
"At one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him.",O
CNN’s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta’s credential violates the First Amendment’s protection of free speech.,O
"It also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment’s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.",O
"Responding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.",O
"“If the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing.",O
“There’s no First Amendment right.”,O
"Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge’s decision, which he said was not a surprise.",O
"“The White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that’s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it’s important that the court stood up and said that,” Lukasiewicz said.",O
“It’s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn’t like.”,O
Lukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.,O
"“The law and the Constitution is very clear here,” he said.",O
"CNN’s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump’s criticisms of the network’s coverage.",O
Rival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.,O
"Fox News commentators were President Barack Obama’s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private.",O

"It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non-hard pass-holding journalists who don’t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do.",O
Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House.,O
"Speaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers.",O

"The temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.",O
