the	O

the	O

he	O
had	O
played	O
in	O
his	O

as	O
McCarrick	O
himself	O
would	O

reveal	O
in	O

in	O

Therefore	O
I	O

We	O
began	O

three	O
points	O
:	O
	
1)Maintenance	O
of	O
the	O
formal	O
autonomy	O
of	O
the	O
Carmels	O
that	O
still	O
exist	O

3)A	O
Supervisory	O

to	O
be	O
appointed	O
periodically	O
by	O
the	O

of	O
people	O
go	O
into	O

some	O

But	O
I	O
think	O
honestly	O
most	O

are	O
in	O
this	O
corner	O

they	O
know	O
it	O

so	O

I	O
think	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
goes	O
forward	O
in	O
great	O
faith	O
,	O
spends	O
ten	O
to	O
fifteen	O
years	O
studying	O
philosophy	O

fields	O
that	O
have	O
almost	O
no	O
application	O
in	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
honest	O

fair	O

expectation	O
of	O
a	O
lifetime	O
of	O

a	O

at	O
the	O

As	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
said	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
“	O

The	O
