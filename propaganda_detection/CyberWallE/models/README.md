### Propaganda detection models

- `model+gridsearch` contains ML models for both subtasks, as well as feature ablation configurations
- `bert_for_sequence_classification` creates the pre-softmax embeddings for the base model of our technique classification system
- `bert_for_token_classification` was used as a preliminary system for span identification
